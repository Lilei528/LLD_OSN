1	TBSCl Protection of primary alcohol...Problems...? I just protected a primary alcohol with TBSCl, using that and TEA, and Cat. DMAP.  Now I have this white ppt that floats around in the solution and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of it. I thought about pulling it off on a column, but that'll probably just deprotect the alcohol and send me back to square one.  Any suggestions???? Gravity filtration, or vacuume filtration.  \n\nIf vacuume then rinse the percipitant in something it won't dissolve in and also something that won't deprotect your alcohol.\n\nThen simply discard it and save the filtrate.5	Should Utah get a MLB baseball team?Explain.? The high altitude will lead to lots of high scoring games. The Royals could move there since there's really nothing for them in KC. The only down part may be the beer sales since most of the state's Mormon. The Royals  have  a lot of history in KC so they probibly wont more. And MLB doesnt like the high altitude. They are trying to do everything to make the ball fly less in Coors Field, so why would they want a new field. I think the high altitude ruins the game, because it just makes the hitters look better, when they arent actually that good.4	When was Internet created?  The USSR's launch of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead. DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the "eve" network of today's Internet. In December of 1970, Charles A. Petrik contacted the U.S. Navy and suggested that a special communications network, that the Department of Defense had built for use in the possiblitity of a nuclear attack, could also be used during peace time. Petrik convinced the military to connect the computers of the U.S. National Laboratories for scientific research purposes, and to allow these labs to get data to other labs faster, and safer.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by 1 January 1983 , when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN, which straddles the border between France and Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN (which was set up by international treaty and not bound by the laws of either France or Switzerland). In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign released the Mosaic web browser version 1.0, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word "Internet" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.5	Would the Cubs lose 90 games even if there were no other teams in the major leagues?  no way..... 88 tops.......9	Which was more important for Adolf Hitler's rise to power? Which was more important for Adolf Hitler's rise to power: his poilicy goals or the symbolism of the Nazi Party? I would argue that policy goals were secondary.\n\nThe Nazi party symbolized all that the German people felt they were lacking, or deserved.\n\nHitler's fiery rhetoric played in perfectly to the masses: they were entirely blamed for WW I and made to pay for it. Discontent ruled people's minds and Hitler understood that very well.\n\nHe exploited a country's sense of powerlessness by promising power. He exploited his country's sense of being victims of injustice by promising revenge upon those who were responsible for Germany's suffering.\n\nThe Nazi party made of point of glorifying everthing good about German history, especially its martial past. He made people feel good about themselves and without that, he never would have had the opportunity to rise to power.9	Why Are Our Boders Wide Open? Why are our borders wide open when we are told terrorists are everywhere and planning to kill us?\n\nHow much money is spend on police and security at our airports, when anyone can walk over the border?\n\nCould it be cheap labour?\n\nWhy are illegals allowed to work and protest in the street?  If I did something illegal I'd get arrested.\n\nIsn't it time we work up to the fact that our nation is no longer a nation of laws but a nation run and manipulated by big powerful corporations?\n\nI appreciate how hard illegal immigrants work and how much they want to come here but that isn't the point.  The concept of a nation is what binds is people together, culture and security.  With wages going down and our borders wide open our security is being destroyed.  Our culture needs to bind a people together.  Laws need to be inforced, not sellectivly ignored.\n\nI can live without fast food chains and convenience stores and slave labour. Why are our borders wide open when we are told terrorists are everywhere and planning to kill us?  \n\nterrorists come on planes and over-stay their visas!!!!  \nthey don't cross the border illegally!!!!  \n\nHow much money is spend on police and security at our airports, when anyone can walk over the border?  \n\ni work about 35 feet from the border and i can tell  you that not anyone can walk across the border!!!!  it takes about 2 hours, documents, and a handful of questions in english for you to be able to cross the border!!!!\n\nCould it be cheap labour?  \n\nimmigrants come to work and they are hired partially for cheap labor but also because they do work that most americans won't do!!!!\n\nWhy are illegals allowed to work and protest in the street? If I did something illegal I'd get arrested.  \n\nDon't assume everyone who protested were illegal....  i for one was not... and i saw many african americans protesting along w/ us!!!!!\n\nIsn't it time we work up to the fact that our nation is no longer a nation of laws but a nation run and manipulated by big powerful corporations?  \n\nno we still have laws but they can be manipulated by what americans truly worship and it's called $$$$$$$$$$$8	i am depressed and dont know what to do:{?

Hello, I'm a young man in my 20's and i have a frequent urination condition. My prostate is not enlarge and i'm not diabetic. I will urinate both days and night very often. Sometimes when i urinate, i have to wait for a few second for the urine to come out and lots of times not a lot urine comes out. Further to the frequent urination condition, my erection has weaken. I can have an erection but not for long. Thank you for your understanding. You can email me as soon as possible. Both of those symptoms indicate a weak PC muscle. This muscle is responsible for both starting and stopping the flow of urine as well as erection strength and holding power.\n\nFortunately, performing PC exercises (also called kegel exercises) will improve your PC muscles greatly.\n\nAs for the issue of over urination, see a doctor as this may be a separate health issue.8	how do i know im over him? im still having dreams about him and its been one month and three days. 5	Why  do the Cleveland Browns suck??

If order matters, if RHO is not the same as ORH, then you would do a permutation.  There are 7 letters in rhombus, so 7 taken 3 at a time is 7P3 = 7!/4! or [7*6*5..*2*1]/[4*3*2*1] = 7*6*5 = 210.\n\nBasically, you have just found not only all the combinations of letters that can be pulled out, but also all the different ways they can be arranged.  If the order doesn't matter, that is RHO is the same as ORH, then you need a combination.\n\n7C3 = 7!/(3!)(4!).  You already found 7!/4!, which was 210.  Now dividing by 3! will undo all the different arrangements of the letters and give you 35 combinations.0	I want to know about Figi? - nature of the island.\n- nature of the inhabitant.\n- living cateogry (expensive/moderate,..)\n- how much a couple need per month to live in moderate level.\n- expected danger (thieves/ viruses/volcano...) Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji, led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE.5	Is it really that big of a deal that Barry Bonds used(allegedly)steroids,it wasn't illegal at the time?!?

Reuben didn’t divulge any source for this figure, and there was no independent verification, so you may question his accuracy. The largest medically verified penis on record is 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches around, documented in the early twentieth century by Dr. Robert L. Dickinson. Other sources (Alfred Kinsey, Masters and Johnson, etc.) mention specimens ranging from 9.5 to 12 inches.\n\nThen there are the dubious claims of immense penis size by various personages operating within the sex industry (read: porn actors). These claims are almost invariably false, the result of exaggeration and hype by unscrupulous dealers hoping to hawk more products. Take the legendary Long Dong Silver, for instance. Made famous by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, his one enduring trait was his supposedly 18-inch penis. Totally fraudulent, as it turns out; in fact, there are videos in which he appears only normal sized.5	How many people are going to skip the Suns v.

It makes no sense to have children; if when your children grow up, they feel you are meddling with them in their lives when they marry and have children.  How are this generation going to react when their children have children and they are told that they have no rights. And that they are meddling, but hand over the money and baby-sit or you are a bad grandparent! Most USA children have become disrespectful to parents when they feel they have grown up and get married.  Who got you to where you are?  And why should we, as denied grandparents, leave an inheritance to you when in fact you deny us our legacy and our grandchildren their heritage? Who do you think you are to tell your mature parents to get lost? Or to tell your spouses parents to take a hike? Good question, most children growing up now have no respect for their elders. Something to do with the parents of the peroid I would imagine.2	Bloody Hands? I don't know why but even though I know there no blood on my hands I feel and see it in my mind.

It's an old question: If you remove *everything* from inside a glass, would the walls touch each other? So can you remove space from inside the glass?\n\nIs a vacuum really empty? We know that there are on a quantum level things like so called vacuum fluctuations. The uncertainty of energy and time allows it for a very short ammount of time to borrow energy from nothing to create a pair of a particle and it's antiparticle, if they annihilate fast enough and give the "borrowed" energy back. This is experimentally confirmed and happens all the time.\n\nSo we can not create a vacuum as the "absence of everything".\n\nIn cosmology scientists had the idea of a "false vacuum" which would be a vacuum which is not in the lowest possible energy state. So you see even the word vacuum is not as simple as it seems.\n\nThe problem is, as you have realized: We don't know what space is made of, especially on a microscopic level. We need to "marry" quantum mechanics with Einsteins general theory of relativism, which would give a quantum theory of gravitation.\n\nUp to now no one was able to do that, there are some fundamental problems. But we have some approaches, one is for example the quantum loop theory which says that space on a very microscopic level has a foam like structure, another one are the super string theories, which say that particles are vibrating strings in a much higher dimensional space (the higer dimensions hve not "unrolled" and are attached to every point in space), but none of them has been experimental tested up to now.\n\nSo the answer to your question is simple: We don't know, but we're working on that.3	Respiratory Therapy?

In science, parsimony is preference for the least complex explanation for an observation. This is generally regarded as good when judging hypotheses.

We start with the most simple likely cause of an event and only move to more complex explanations when we can rule out the more simple explanation.4	Faster Computers?

And in Meiois I you end up with 2 cells which then divide again in Meiosis II?? \nand one other question- What are the benefits from sexual reproduction from meiosis that does not occur in asexual repro.\nthanks Meiosis takes place in two stages: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis 2.\nAt the end of meiosis 1, you have two haploid cells with double stranded chromosomes.\nAt the end of meiosis 2, you have four haploid cells with single stranded chromosomes.\n\nCrossing over- the stage of meiosis that allows for genetic variability- occurs when the chromatids form tetrads during prophase 1 of meiosis.  This is the only stage that this is able to take place.\n\nSexual reproduction has the benefit of genetic variability.  The coding that will most help the offspring is passed on more frequently than the coding that would give it no selective advantage.\nAsexual reproduction makes exact copies- it would take longer for the organism to adapt to a change in the environment, as it would have to mutate.  This could be very bad for the organism, as the species may die off before the mutation in the genes takes place.4	i was trying to download photo file.a pop up window blocked me. what do i do?  its is copyrighted..they needd to protect the photo...\n\nStill if you want to do it...\n\nDisable java script.\nIf IE user, \nYou have a browser called avant browser ( http://www.avantbrowser.com/ )that runs IE in background .. but has extra buttons to enable or disable such thing \nelse \nIf using mozilla/firefox...\nuse the No script and fiddle (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/722/)\n\nthat should work.. though some sites wont let you browse if you disable, in that case.. cant help.0	If I snuck behind God and gave him some "truth serum" what would he say?

It is true that there are a lot of "services" that buy houses directly from homeowners.  However you will be walking away from a lot of money.  \n\nIf you need to sell your house quickly I would do this.  I would ask one of these services for an estimate.  I would then interview 3 top real estate agents in the area.  I would ask them for an estimate of the value of the house.  Say you get an offer from the company for 150K and the real estate agents say the house is worth 210K.  I would sign a listing agreement for 30 days and offer the house at 191K which will yield you 180K(the average) when you take out the commission.  Or you might consider asking 195K to give you a little room to offer closing help or offer 4% to the buyer agent.3	What is a another way to say "for example" in an essay or paragraph?

For example, track-one might carry the drums recording, track-2 might have the bass-guitar recording, track-3 might include your media sample at the proper time...etc  (you get the idea).\n\n   When you have your tracks recorded, such a machine will output everything together to a line-out jack (usually a mini-plug like headphones, but sometimes a 1/4'' plug).  You can then record it all to one track of tape, cd, mp3, or whatever you can plug it into.\n\nNow, studio recorders used to be pretty expensive, but as computers have taken over their role in large part, you can often find used ones pretty cheap.  As I suggested, try ebay.  You may also find that a small local recording studio will do the mix for you for a small fee.\n\nI hope this helps you.2	what are side efects of CHOLESTROL reducing drugs such as LESCOL.?

What was the intent of the law that protects retirement funds off limits to legal penalties?  I can understand not wanting to have indigent cons and ex-cons.  But it seems like you could accomplish that by saying the first 2 or 3 million dollars is off limits to legal action.  But $33 million??!!  OJ rakes in $25k a month!

Do you think they will ever return?\nWill they have to become Jews if they do? Hi there,\n\nI'm a historian and I focus on ancient history. I can tell you that the 10 lost tribes were taken out of the Northern Israelite Kingdom, known as Samria in the early 8th century BC. This is when the Assyrian Armies captured Samaria, not only is this documented in history but in the bible as well. I think it's in I Kings. \n\nAnyway, after the Assyrian conquest, the 10 tribes were scattered throughout the eastern portion of the Assyrian Empire by King Sargon. From this point on it appears that they took the name Scythians (or Kuthia in Persian). However, there's no real proof of the name-change. It is well known however, that historically speaking they ceased to be a people after the Assyrian conquest, and other peoples were relocated to Samaria from throughout the Empire to populate Samaria. These new people, not at all related to the Jews that still lived in Judea. \nI hope this helps you. God bless!9	Which country gained the most out of Iraq War and lost nothing?

There was a documentary or film (non-fiction) that aired between 2001-2003 on HBO, Cinnemax or STARZ late at night. It was a very unusual story about a man who fell in love with a nurse (I think). The nurse died young from something and the husband (a doctor I think) became obsessed with her. He got permission from the parents to bury her above ground and treat her body with chemicals to perserve her better. He would spend hours, nights and then days in the above ground tomb (a small room on a graveyard) that housed her body. He then stole the body and lived with the corpse (sleeping with her, and even having sexual contact with her) before he was discovered. \n\nI can't find the name of the film or any information about the events or people that would lead me to find the film or more info about this bizarre story. Someone else must have seen this film or know about this case? I know it!!! It wasn't a film exactly. It was Autopsy with Dr. Baden. I think Autopsy 6??? But there was Someone Von Cosel who treated this girl, she died, he was in love, yada yada yada, you remembered the story pretty well.

I heard that Washington D.C. had a higher percapita death rate that Iraq.  I looked it up but couldn't find anything. easeing my curiosity would be appreciated? You probably heard that D.C. has a lower rate of death due to firearms. It's a moronic comparison because of all the troops killed by IED, etc. but here you go:\n\n\nIf you consider that there have been an average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq theater of operations during the last 22 months, that gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000. \n\nThe rate in Washington D.C. is 80.6 per 100,000. That means that you are 25% more likely to be shot and killed in our Nation's Capitol, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, than you are in Iraq.3	i need to understand the function of the 3’UTR and polyA tail in translation?  i know the polyA tail protects the mRNA sequence from degrading and makes it live longer..im not sure but i think the polyA tail attaches it self to the end of the 3primeUTR2	I know someone who drinks rubbing alcohol. what can i do?  You correct in recognizing this as a dangerous habit. Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol is quite toxic. When ingested your body breaks it down in to acetone, a chemical commonly found in nail polish remover. Clearly this is not safe. Your friend is abusing a substance. There are some commonalities in people who abuse substances. Primarily being that they are using the substance for an effect that aides them in escaping reality. Your Friend is a drug addict. He/she must desire to help himself/herself. You cannot force them into recovery no matter what you say, but this does not mean that you should not push your friend to seek help. Perhaps your friends does not know that treatment options are available. They are. The National Institute on Drug abuse has many paths that will help you to talk to your friend about the substance abuse as well as  centers for treatment.

You solve these sort questions by calculating the energy contained in the sample (blocat?) and the water initially, and realizing the final energy content must be the same, or less if the system has lost energy to the environment.\n\nIf you actually run this experiement in a lab, you will find that the final temperature is the same as the air temperature of the lab.  If it would be warmer, you did not wait long enough, the system would lose energy to its environment.  The 2nd Law of Thermo prevents the reverse from occurring.  This is probably not the expected answer, but I believe it is correct.0	do you get a lot of flack for being in another religion? im a protestant and my ex's parents and, whole family actually, is catholic..they frown upon my religion and they wanted me to convert. they said that God will be happier or something..

Hernias can occur in many areas of the abdomen, and can be harmless or very serious.  When hernias become strangulated (trapped bewteen the muscular wall and blood supply is cut off) then the bowel can lose its blood supply and die... this condition requires immediate surgery.  Minor hernias are usually more of a cosmetic thing and do not cause much serious problems (unless they strangulate) but if you ever have to have surgery on your stomach (gall bladder, appendix, etc) then you should have it fixed at the same time.8	Girls, Do You Like A Furry Man?

Ive known most of them before middle school. and ive always been invited to their parties and get togethers. so i dont need to use this party. and i wouldnt want to. is my bestfriend just jealous or am i doing something wrong? \n\nplease nothing mean i just really want to know. You are not doing anything wrong. It sounds to me as if your BF is a little jealous and upset because you are doing something with someone other then her. Don't let her get to you, just let her know that if she can not control herself and act like a BF and be supportive then you don't need her to be at your party. Not trying to be mean but the purpose of a party is to have fun and you can't do that if you are constantly defending yourself and your other friends to her.7	whats ur fav song akon smack dat [dj unk walk it out ]dj webstar chicken noodle soup or chris brown run it?

I am using onClipEvent (mouseUp) with a movie clip. When the user clicks the movie clip, it brings up an swf. The problem is, that this swf is there from the start, and it works fine if the user decides to click on another button first, before the banner... but if the user goes straight to the banner, it loads the swf a second time and it sits on top of the old one. How can I prevent it from reloading if it's already loaded? It starts out with the movie clip on the stage, then if a button or banner is clicked, it's removed. The problem is that when it is reloaded, it is from an outside swf.. so there's two seperate situations- movie clip starting on stage, movie clip loading from external swf. Try giving the clip an id.  In the onClipEvent check to see if the contents of the ID exist, if they do, then don't load, but if it doesn't then don't load.... basically, use JavaScript and the Document Object Model to determine state of the object, and only load if the object doesn't yet exist.\n\nI hope that helps and makes sense.

A lot of the times the theif usually has a big mouth and tends to try to turn the employees against the employer. I see this at my work place all the time. But in the end they are small minded individuals. Best thing is to have small meetings with each person and let them know how u feel or maybe do an evaluation week with your employees. Good LUck and Catch the bastard!2	hypnosis to quit smoking? has anyone tried quitting smoking by using hypnosis. i've tried the patch twice and it hasn't worked permanately. so i've decided to give hypnosis a shot, would like to hear some opinions on this. thank you. Hypnosis is one of many viable options for those interested in quitting smoking.\n\nIn fact, a study conducted at the University of Iowa in 1992 found that hypnosis was the MOST effective treatment for smoking cessation as compared to other techniques (patch, gum, etc).  \n\nResearchers conducted a meta-analysis, which combines the results of more than 600 studies covering 72,000 people in the U.S. who participated in various cessation techniques. They found that subjects that underwent hypnotism had the highest success rate of quitting.\n\nThis is just one of many scientific studies that have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of hypnosis.  Thousands of studies can be found on PubMed, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.8	Will I find the person right from me?

I recently seen a story on television's "Good Morning America" about people donating their kidney's to others in need. I was just wondering if anyone knows if there are any complications to the donators after losing one of their organs. I just cannot seem to understand how someone is able to have an organ removed and continue to live. Why would something be there if it was not meant to be used by your own body? Because you have 2 kidneys, a human can function fine with just 1 HEALTHY kidney, the doctors do all sorts all tests to make sure that the kidney is healthy before you donate.9	Who was the first and only country to use a nuclear weapon against a city?

I was raised pennacostal but For many years have not felt a part of that church. My husband doesn't care if I never become catholic and niether does any of his family. I am very faithful and since I have been with him (4 years) I have been going to his church. I began the RCIA program at his church to convert but because of bad timing and a bad experience I haven't continued. What gets me is that the catholic church beleives that even though I was dedicated (what I always beleived to be baptised) isn't the same as being baptized. To join the caltholic church I'd have to become baptized at 24 years old and that sort of seems to me like I'm saying all the the religion I recieved as a young adult didn't really count and NOW I'm getting to the stuff that counts. Does that seem weird? yea i know what you mean about being baptized...i'm also catholic =P...uhh well i don't know the customs of other christian branches but catholics have a set of symbolic ceremonies. well im guessing you know wat the "original" sin was...the whole adam and eve thing...the ceremony is just symbolic for washing away that sin and joining the catholic church...there's like "first communion" and finally your "confirmation" into the catholic faith...as i said alot of ceremonies. it's just the many ways to verify your faith throughout your life and accepting God. i think its understandable that you feel you're denouncing your previous faith but you shouldn't feel that way though. i don't know what you're going through because i was born into it but maybe if you become more involved in the church you'll feel a better connection with God. besides thats all that matters right? your connection with God? there's no shame in being baptised at 24 =). having the same religion as your husband will probobly be nice for when you have children you know...cuz then you would be going to church together. i know alot of people who don't share their spouse's religion and their children are a bit lost and usually don't believe in anything at all. well good luck!7	Cow has it in his back.

My husband just got his mcat score of 15 and is devastated. His gpa is about a 3.5. He has already applied to about 30 schools all over the U.S. and Mexico. What are the chances of him being accepted?? Unless he is african american, hispanic, or native american - not too good, at least for US schools. If he is willing to go to the Caribbean or Mexico, then he will be fine. Those schools aren't too concerned about MCAT scores as long as you can afford the tuition. Be sure he applies to Ross University - probably the best of the Caribbean schools.\n\nIf he wants to stay in the US - better take the August test. I would suggest taking a Princeton Review course.8	Where would you go if you could buy a $20,000 or greater engagement ring . . .TYIA?  http://www.bluenile.com/engagement_choose_ring.asp\nhttp://www.uniondiamond.com/engagement-rings.html\nhttp://platinum.goldenmine.com/\nhttp://www.hkjewellery.co.uk/default.asp?Page=engagementrings-readytowear\n\nTake a look at these sites and you will find expensive rings!!!

Suppose you fell in love with someone other than your husband / spouse of 15 years.  You still love your husband, very much, you are just not "in" love with him; you are in love with this other person.  The other is still in love with you, but chooses his wife.  To top it all off, you have to think of the best situation for your children to grow up in.  Suggestions?  Cutting it off completely doesn't seem to be working.  Counseling is helping, a little, but it is a long process, and the relationship has existed for almost a year. It will take time, and much effort on your part, to let the lover go. Stop all contact with him/her; when you find your mind wandering to him/her, stop and think of something else; focus on your family and your marriage.\n\nFind something good about your spouse that attracted you to him/her in the first place.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\nHave you done everything you can think of to salvage what's left of your marriage?\n\nDo you have any feelings at all left for your spouse, be they negative or positive?\n\nIf you answer "yes" to either of those questions, there is still something left, and you should work on it and give all your energy to it.

GMAIL IS STILL BEING BETA TESTED SO THE PART YOU FIRST SEE WHEN YOU FIRST LOGIN ISN"T WORKING CORRECTLY YET. NOT ALL OF THE FEATURES IN THAT SECTION HAVE BEEN ADDED YET. AT THE VERY TOP YOU WILL SEE A LINK THAT SAYS "STANDARD VIEW" CLICK ON IT TO GET TO THE WORKING PART OF GMAIL.\n\nOne of the best features is how easy it is to keep up with a conversation with a single friend. All of your previous posts to that\nperson are right there for you to review in case you forgot what you were talking about. Another good feature is that everyone that emails you is automatically added into your contacts list (address book). Currently there is no way to opt out of that. Maybe later they will add that feature.\n\nGMail is currently in beta testing and isn't ready to be released to the general public. This is why you had to be invited to use it instead of just signing up for it like you would normally do with everything else. Because it is still being tested it will occasionally not do what you want it to do. When this happens keep trying until it gives up and report it to one of the following GMail Help groups below.\n\nUsually after a week or two you will be given the ability to invite others to Gmail. You will know when the time comes because a form will appear in the lower-left corner of your screen. Also when answering an email you will see a link that says "Invite So And So To Gmail". So and so is the name of the person you are emailing.\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-Discussion\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Generation\nhttp://s90215429.onlinehome.us/sjvilla79/content/gg-faq.html\n\nOther helpful GMail links.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail\nhttp://email.about.com/od/gmail/\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=gmail&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N\n\nPLUS ADDRESSING\n\nGmail also supports "plus-addressing" of emails. Messages can be sent to addresses in the form: gmail.user+extratext@gmail.com where extratext can be any string. Plus-addressing allows users to sign up for different services with different aliases and then easily filter all e-mails from those services. It does not appear, however, that the +string feature works when sending email from a gmail account to itself. Additionally (in some cases) the string appended to the e-mail address may not be longer than six characters.

None of the ideas suggested in the answers so far would result in an end of ALL life on earth. As humans we think of ourselves as important, but in the greater scheme of things we are not. A biog comet impact might wipe out humans, but it would not wipe out life, in fact for many of the surviving species it would be a very poitive outcome, getting rid of homo sapiens, the planets biggest poluters and parasites. The end of lie on Earht is likely to happen when the sun reaches the end of it current stage of hydrogen fusion, this will happen in about 5 billion yeras, so we are hal way there. the sun will at first contract, then as it gets hot enough for Helium to fuse it will expand and become a REd Giant. THIS will end life on earth, effectively. The earth may even be swallowed up as the sun swells to a diameter of around 300,000,000 km which is about the same as the earths orbit (so the earth would be at the surface of the sun).4	How to access the variables defined in one class by next class in java?

His 15 year old girlfriend (I know, horrible)just gave birth to his child. A detective came to investigate because the hospital reported him to the police. They were afraid he would be arrested, so they quickly went and got married (yes, with her dumb mother's permission). I say he can still be arrested. My best friend says she doesn't think so now. Who is right? He could be arrested, but it wouldn't amount to anything now.  If the girls mother wanted to press charges, he could have been charged with at least statutory rape.  Since the girls mother gave permission for them to marry, she can no longer file charges--therefore, there isn't really a case here for him to be arrested for.  Having a baby is one of the stupidest reasons to get married!  That decision is going to haunt them for the rest of their lives.  Being married is hard enough when you're old enough to realize all that it means--at their age, they barely know how to wipe their own butts!  Adding a child to the mix is just asking for trouble--I don't care how mature you are, or how well you think you're prepared for it--parenthood changes everything!  Having a child first, then getting married because you have a child is, from my own personal experience, a VERY big mistake!  I'd rather see 2 people who love and care for their child never marry than marry and be miserable.  I hope your friends mother is ready to not only raise her own child, but her grandchild and a son in law as well!  Make sure you stick around for your friend--somehow I think she's gonna need as much support as she can get in the very near future--when her life totally falls apart.  I wish her luck and truly hope she won't be another statistic, but I'm being realistic and calling it how I see it--a bad situation that will get much worse.5	just some clarification? Just to let everyone know I am a girl. Some of you seem to think I am a guy. but I am a girl who really like baseball. So...what's your question?2	what is the inner child?  People with persistent problems such as addiction, depression, troubled relationships and chronic dissatisfaction can transform their lives with Inner Child Work and find a new joy and energy in living. \nThe source of their problems can be in past events which get triggered in the present. We’re made up of many parts and inside we still have the little child and adolescent we were with all its experiences and feelings. This can lead to this Inner Child / adolescent part of us reacting strongly to certain experiences and situations and the feelings we’re having in the present can be the feelings of this little child / adolescent from the past. The process of opening to the world of you Inner Child and getting to know where these feelings come from can change that and enhance your choices in miraculous ways. \nCarl Jung called it the "Divine Child" and Emmet Fox called it the "Wonder Child." Some psychotherapists call it the “True Self” and Charles Whitfield called it the “Child Within”. \nThe Inner Child refers to that part of each of us which is ultimately alive, \nThe Inner Child is the emotional self. It is where our feelings live. When we experience joy, sadness, anger, fear, or affection our Child Within is coming out. When we are being playful, spontaneous, creative, intuitive and surrendering to the spiritual self, our Genuine Authentic Self, who we know deep within us, our Real Self is being welcomed and encouraged to be present. We all have an inner child and the wounds our inner child received can and do continue to contaminate our adult lives. Our parents helped create this Inner Child part of us, society also helped with the creation. When this child self is not allowed to be heard or even acknowledged as being real, a false or co-dependent self emerges. We begin to live our lives as victims. \nThen we have situations that arise in our lives which develop into unresolved emotional traumas. The gradual accumulation of unfinished mental and emotional business can lead to and fuel chronic anxiety, fear, confusion, emptiness and unhappiness through all of our life. \nBesides the Inner Child / adolescent part, we have many other selves which are trying to be heard and take control, without us really hearing the voices until we make an effort to do so. Initially, it is very important to tame the Inner Critic part of us. That voice from the past often keeps beating up our Inner Child. This voice invades whatever trauma and pain there was in our childhood. The wise Nurturing Self part of us can learn to stand as a protector self for the Inner Child. It’s the job of the Nurturer to be loving and self-affirming. This part of us can also teach the Inner Critic a new job of support instead of beating the Child self up, and can love the Inner Critic so that the Inner Child self can relax and not have to work so hard. \nThis is often where the internal battle begins. The Inner Critic has been keeping the Inner Child muffled and secluded. Often, it is a case of transforming the Inner Critic to be a good internal parent, beginning to listen to the Inner Child and to allow it to have fun and be heard. \nDenial of the Inner Child and the co-dependent self are particularly common among children and adults who grew up in troubled or dysfunctional families. This is where chronic physical mental illness, rigidity, frigidity or lack of nurturing is common. Yet, there is a way out. There is a way to discover and to heal our Inner Child / adolescent part and to break free of the bondage and suffering of our co-dependent or false self. \nThrough Inner Child Work with Elevated Therapy, it’s the easiest thing in the world to turn our feelings inwards and connect directly with that part of us that can offer comfort and support. \nThis is called self-nurturing or re-parenting which allows us to reclaim that wounded child.  We can provide for ourselves all the love and support and positive regard we never had1	help with number one? A child's bank contains $6.30 in dimes and quarters.

We need a day that we as Americans can show the ones in Washington and the Businesses that we want Illegals out of our country. A day that we stay home from work and display our dismay in the streets in a peaceful manner that we do not want Amnesty for People who break our laws.

I think McVeigh was one of those people who are looking for validation.  Because he was a little strange, a little different, he didn't get that in the mainstream of society.  So, he got in with a bunch of kooks and he looked pretty normal and as a matter of fact he could stand out and be a leader in that group of right wing conspiracy kooks.  He was relatively smart and he was also very guliible at the same time.  He was perfect lacky for the nut jobs that he associated with.\n\nHe was a model soldier in the U.S. Army because he was gun ho and followed orders, never questioned authority.  But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests, he lost faith.  This rejection devasted him.  It created anger toward the American government and military.  He channeled his anger into right wing extremist hate groups.  The very reasons which made him a great soldier for the Army then made him a solider for right wing hate groups.5	who is the first Kenyan player  to play for  a french club.?  it must be dennis oliech...f.c nantes8	HELP!!!...boy trouble...? ive liked dis guy for 2-3 months & hes a really cool person.i love that he is taller than me[i am also tall] he makes me laugh alot.&so many people think we are related[we are not] today wen i was talking to him one of his friends walked by was like,"awww" and looked right at us.ive been getting to know him alot better than before.hes a freshman & im a sophmore.we are both really into sports.we dont have any classes together.we see eachother during all passing periods.wierd thing is...3 days ago was the first time he ever hugged me and now everytime we see eachother we hug & ive noticed that after one of my classes hes in the class right next to me, he used to never really walk slow & lately hes been walking slower w/ me & puts his arm around me sometimes... like da other day.. he said he forgot something so he walked back but wen he got to me he turned around & said ohh yea i gave it to my friend.iono if dat da truth o not.can you help me out i think he like me but iono do u think so? from your description, i think both of you are couples made in heaven. go for it. this can be the beginning of a beautiful and romantic relationship.\n\ngive the man a chance, develop the relationship, let it grow and when you have a chance, tell him how you feel.

Lean on one arm and then the other while sitting?  Lean your elbows on the armrests in your vehicle?  How about reading/doing homework while stretched out on the floor, leaning on  your elbows?\n\nNot all hand numbness indicates carpal tunnel syndrome.  What you describe is a common experience for freelance writers like myself.  We tend to suffer pinched nerves in our elbows, which demonstrate numbness in the pinky fingers, then heels of the hand (the portion of hand under the pinky to the wrist), then up the bottom part of the forearm.  As the nerve becomes more and more pinched, more fingers, hand portions and forearm become affected.\n\nI suggest you first notice what you're doing with your arms.  Refrain from leaning whenever you notice you do so.  The physical therapy other writers and I have been assigned to relieve such numbness is simple:\n\n1.  While standing with your feet hip-width apart, slightly tuck pelvis (tighen tummy to support lower back), stretch top-back of head toward the ceiling (slightly jut out chin, then lower chin to feel the strectch in the spine), roll shoulders up, back, down (breast-bone will feel lifted) and hold position.\n\n2.  While arms are at sides, turn out affected arm's hand, slowly raise up arm, bend foream down so elbow is pointing at ceiling and hand points down back.\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised elbow behind head (your head may slightly move ahead as you do this).\n\n4.  Repeat on other side if necessary.\n\nNext, while standing with both arms down in that beginning position; \n\n1.  Raise affected arm straight out to the side.\n\n2.  Slowly, without turning torso, move arm across chest so the fingers point to opposite side (if you are tight in the shoulders, you may not be able to get your arm to go very far...not a problem).\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised arm into chest.\n\n4.  Repeat on opposite side as needed.\n\nAt night, notice whether or not you are sleeping on one side, falling asleep on  your side with one arm under the pillow and your head resting on that side.\n\nIf you are, then do what you can to change up your falling-asleep position for a while.  You may very well wake up in the position you attempted to change, but you will have at least spared your body some crushed nerve time in the process.\n\nTry these exercises for a week or so.  Take anti-imflammatory ibuprofen.  If you still do not experience any relief, then visit your doctor.3	not interested in school?

I wonder what @ is called in English.\n\nBut it would be interesting to know it in other languages too, which  you talk. *History*\nThe @ sign may have evolved from the Norman French "à"\n\n@ appears to be the cursive form of ā, an abbreviation of an unknown word beginning with a. In medieval European manuscripts, abbreviations were generally indicated by drawing a line over or through the letters, as in the common IX for Jesus Christ, or # from lb for libra 'pound'. In the typeface of the Gutenberg Bible, ā stands for either an or am within words. However, it is not known which particular word gave rise to modern @.\n\nA commonly accepted theory is that the symbol is derived from the Latin preposition ad, which means about with numerals. However, no document showing this usage has been presented.\n\nA similar idea is that @ is the abbreviation of the Greek preposition ana (ανά), which means 'at the rate of' when used with numerals, exactly its modern commercial usage.\n\nA more recent idea has been proposed by Giorgio Stabile, a professor of history in Rome. He claims to have traced the symbol back to the Italian Renaissance in a Venetian mercantile document signed by Francesco Lapi on May 4, 1536. The document talks about commerces with Pizarro and in particular the price of an @ of wine in Peru, where <@> stood for amphora (Italian anfora; Spanish and Portuguese arroba). The word arroba still means both the @ symbol and a unit of weight (see below). Under this view, the symbol was used to represent one amphora, which was a unit of weight or volume based upon the capacity of the standard terracotta jar, and came into use with the modern meaning "at the rate of" in northern Europe.\n\nHowever, @ could be the abbreviation of any word beginning in a, and more than one such symbol was likely in use, but there is no continuous record between any of the possibilities and the modern symbol.\n\nAn alternative view is that it derives from Norman French "à" meaning "at" in the sense of "each". "2 widgets à £5.50 = £11.00" is the sort of accountancy shorthand notation you will see on English commercial vouchers and ledgers all the way into the 1990s, where the usage was superseded for accountants with its e-mail usage. It is used in this way in Modern French also.\n\nAccording to this view, the @ symbol is simply a stylish way of writing the à, so as not to remove the hand from the page in making the symbol. You can see hybrids between @ and à in French handwriting in street markets to this day.\n\n*Modern uses*\nThe symbol's most familiar modern use is in e-mail addresses (sent by SMTP), as in jdoe@example.com ("the user named ‘jdoe’ working at the computer named ‘example’ in the ‘com’ domain"). Ray Tomlinson is credited with the introduction of this use in 1972. This idea of user@host is seen in many other tools and protocols as well: for example, the command ssh jdoe@www.example.com would try to establish a ssh connection to the box with the hostname www.example.com using the username jdoe.\n\nIn the programming language Perl, the symbol prefixes variables which contain arrays, as opposed to scalar values (indicated with '$') and hash tables / associative arrays ('%'). If the code were to be treated as a sentence, this prefix would be the equivalent of a determiner, so "@animals" might be read as "these animals".\n\nIn the IRC protocol, @ is the symbol for a channel operator. IRC also uses the user@host form (often preceded by nick!) for identifying and banning users. In this case the user@ part was originally an ident response and the host part was a reverse dns name from the user's IP. However, most modern IRC networks provide some mechanism for users to hide their real reverse dns hostname and/or for admins/privileged users to pick one arbitrarily.\n\nThe @ character is also used as an alternative political spelling for typing in some Romance languages as a gender-neutral substitute for the6	How can I start a shopping website?

Indians (Native Americans) who helped save them? Sorry for having copied/pasted twice ( by mistake) but I sure think it needs to be reminded LOL :-))!\n\n\nThanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is an annual one-day holiday to give thanks (traditionally to God), for the things one has at the close of the harvest season. In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, and in Canada it is celebrated on the second Monday in October. In the United Kingdom, Thanksgiving is another name for the Harvest festival, held in churches across the country on a relevant Sunday to mark the end of the local harvest, though it is not thought of as a major event (compared to Christmas or Easter) as it is in North America, where this tradition taken by early settlers became much more important. Other European countries, such as Germany, also have harvest-thanks (Erntedank) celebrations which are perceived to be rather minor and mostly rural holidays.\n\nThanksgiving in the United States\nThe first official Thanksgiving was held in the Virginia Colony on December 4, 1619 near the current site of Berkeley Plantation, where celebrations are still held each year in November.[2]\n\n\nPilgrims\nThe Pilgrims were particularly thankful to Squanto, the Indian who taught them how to catch eel, grow corn and who served as an interpreter for them (Squanto had learned English on a previous trip to Europe). Without Squanto's help the Pilgrims might not have survived in the new world. The Pilgrims set apart a day to celebrate at Plymouth immediately after their first harvest, in 1621. At the time, this was not regarded as a Thanksgiving observance; harvest festivals were existing parts of English and Wampanoag tradition alike. Several American colonists have personal accounts of the 1621 feast in Massachusetts:\n\nThanksgiving in the United States\nThe first official Thanksgiving was held in the Virginia Colony on December 4, 1619 near the current site of Berkeley Plantation, where celebrations are still held each year in November.[2]\n\n\nPilgrims\nThe Pilgrims were particularly thankful to Squanto, the Indian who taught them how to catch eel, grow corn and who served as an interpreter for them (Squanto had learned English on a previous trip to Europe).

The Monty Pithon had a song "Money makes the world go round" \n\nBut since the question is in the astronomy category, perhaps you are after the serious answer.  Momentum.  The earth condensed from particles at the beginning of the solar system, and all those small rocks were in orbit around the sun, thus had momentum in them.  By falling into one another, they gave that momentum to the accumulating mass, which started spinning.  Actually, all planets rotate, it is the norm rather than the exception.\n\nBeing in space, without anything substantial to slow it down, save from the moon and sun tidal effect, the earth keeps spinning since then.7	What is hateful, green but pleasurable?

Please explain the reason for your answer :) I think that the universe is divine. That the expanding and contracting correspond to the Hindu view of the great cycle of Brahman breathing in and out. We begin at the starting point, evolve until we return to that same point. So what you've described above, that united existence, is pretty much the way it is regardless. (And before someone jumps on this and says they, aka scientists, no longer believe in a contracting universe ... That was before they discovered that each galaxy has a black hole at its center that draws everything in on itself. Once the galaxies have folded in upon themselves they will begin to draw each other until ... Contraction. Funny how contractions always come before birth. lol )6	How to earn 1 million dollars in five or ten years ? ( Exemption : Robbery, Lottery and illegal stuff)?

I had surgery on my sinuses last march, but the first time that I got one was this January.  It only bleeds on my right side, and afterwards my head hurts on that side.  It hurts for at least a day. well it could be because u have nasal polyps, bloody noses and headaches are common signs and symptoms.  poylps are just little outgrowths of tissue, you can get them anywhere in your body where there is tissue.  Another sign/symptom is snoring - ask your significant other if u snore at night.  but either way, u should get it looked at.  these types of polyps can be removed by nasal sprays or by outpatient surgery.  deffinatly get it looked at!

I had a third degree burn on my left knee as a child.The Dr told me there is a possibility there is a burn carcinoma now. What is this? I know carcinoma is cancer but I had never heard of this before. SUMMARY.  Marjolin's ulcer is defined as a malignant, ulcerating neoplasm occurring in cicatricial tissue, and is thought to be more aggressive than the other more common varieties of skin cancers. It has been reported in chronic scars of diverse origins. The following report describes two cases of burn scar carcinoma. A review is made of the literature pertaining to the mechanisms, paihological findings, clinical presentation, prognosis, prevention and treatment of this malignant degeneration of burn scars.\n\nIntroduction\nThe association between thermal burn scars and neoplasia was initially recognized by Celsus in AD 100 (Treves and Pack, 1930). Jean Nicolas Marjolin, writing in 1828, is widely credited with the first description of tumour arising in bum scars (Marjolin, 1828). It was De Costa in 1903 who first coined the term "Marjolins's ulcer", applying it to tumours arising in simple leg ulcers. Although Steffen (1984) and Nancarrow (1983) have pointed out that Marjolin probably did not recognize the malignant nature of these ulcers, most other authors have all iden'tified the malignancy found in burn scars such as Marjolin's ulcer. Today the term "Marjolin's ulcer" is used to describe malignant turnours arising in many different types of cutaneous scars and chronic wounds, such as bum scars, chronic venous ulcers, pressure ulcers (decubitus ulcers), osteomyelitis sinuses, urinary fistulas, pilonidal sinuses, gummata, smallpox vaccination scars and radiation scars (Abbas and Beecham, 1988; Barr and Menard, 1983; Berkwits et al., 1986; Fishman and Parker, 1991; Nancarrow, 1983; Steffen, 1984). Butterworths Medical Dictionary (MacNalty, 1965) now defines Marjolin's ulcer as any cancer arising in association with a chronic sinus, ulcer or scar.6	who sings that song the first nightingales song its a christmas song?

It's quite embarrassing but someone I know is in this situation. the old head of of my old college would up marrying a sixth former he taught.\n\nnumerous people (one or two that I know) wind up in some kind of relationship during the five to seven years that people are in school. It's human and statistics dictate that out of all the kids and teachers and all the time they spend together you will get relationships blooming... it's inevitable.\n\nthe results too can be disastrous or really beautiful.\n\nthe teacher has a unique power over their partner because of how the relationship is likely to have developed. that's why it's frowned upon, because that kind of influence can wreck someone's life. I think the situation might be moot because you don't know what they teacher thinks about the girl as opposed to what he thinks about his job and his reputation.. there are just too many variables to give a sensible suggestion about what to do.\n\ngirls have crushes and crushes come and go. she will embarrass herself or not as the case may be. she might succeed in snaring him....\n\ngood luck to all parties concerned! :-)1	I want to root my nepenthes..

I have felt on many occasions, that I should be crying, because people I know who are in the same situation as me are crying. I feel the same way they do, and i hurt inside, but sometimes the tears just won't come out. I think I would feel better if I could just cry. But how? Don't worry about how you're suppose to express your pain or even joy for that fact. Just react as you normally would. Some people are less over-the-top with the way they express thier emotions. Those who really know and accept you for the way you are will know how to read your emotional state. Don't force yourself to put on big dramatic displays of emotional expression. It's not natural.Accept how you are. You seem to be strong. Not everyone must cry when they feel pain. Sometimes it is necessary but only if it comes naturally. Your innability to cry right now might be one of your strengths. \n\nPerhaps right now you are going to be strong one who helps your friends through what ever is going on. In other ways you might need thier support. Accept who you are and how you deal with pain and the rest will work itself out.7	have you ever said 'i love you' to someone without meaning it?

You must be certain before you proceed with any remedial action!  If it is a tumor, either benign or malignant then other, more aggressive directions of treatment should be engaged.\n\nThomas has a very good point about anti-perspirants.  Most specifically, you should adamantly avoid aluminum chloride, which is a primary ingredient of most deodorants off the shelf.  There are some excellent enzymatic salt sticks that do a fine job of eliminating under-arm odor, which will not subject the under-arm lymphatic and breast regions to heavy metal toxicity.  Aluminum is a metal, and chlorine is toxic (by O.S.H.A.s standards), and although it's not conclusive yet, anti-perspirants are believed by many to contribute to breast cancer.\n\nLastly and most importantly - if it is a cyst, then you must remember that cysts develop as a result of an irritant.  Much in the same way that pearls develop as a result of irritants in the shell.  Unfortunately, we are not capable of turning an internal irritant into a pearl.\n\nSo, I will share with you my personal experience regarding a rather pesky ovarian cyst.   My acupuncturist (who is also a 40 year practicing herbalist, trained in a many locations around the world, including China) successfully diverted the misdirected energy that the cyst was using to grow.  And, after a few accu. treatments, my next ultrasound showed no sign of the cyst.  Remember, cysts must draw from the normal energy relegated to the area that the cyst had developed within.\n\nWhat I strongly suggest is that you find a very good TRADITIONAL acupuncturist and discuss your situation with him or her.  \n\nI would also suggest that you engage a systemic de-tox plan.  Using dietary changes and herbal de-tox assistance.  Please don't forget to attend to your liver and kidneys, as they are your body's filtration system.  \n\nGood luck.  Any anomoly regarding the breasts is terribly disconcerting.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.5	10k runs in uk?

Check out Allocation of Income and Expenses, schedule P form 5735 at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf.  This is the basic form you are looking for.\n\nYou can deduct any equipment that is used exclusively for the business, like a file cabinet, which can be depreciated, usually over seven years, where you recover the expense of the equipment over time.  You can also deduct the expenses for your car when used to travel for the business.  You must keep a mileage log to qualify.  If you use a computer and deduct it then that computer must be devoted entirely to the business, any personal programs on it will cancel this deduction\n\nYou can deduct part of your home expenses for the area of the home that you use exclusively for your business, but this is a red flag for the IRS, and can force an audit.  If you want this deduction then make sure that part of the house is used only for business.  I knew an Amway dealer that had a system of shelves in the garage for storing his stock.  That would be a legal deduction, and you will may need some space to store stock and samples.\n\nYou will need to use the 1040 tax form and remember to pay the self-employment tax (Check out lines 13, 24, 27,28, 29).  You will need to fill out Schedule SE Self-Employment Tax (instructions are found at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/i1040sse.pdf the form itself is found at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf)  Use Form 8829 Expenses for Business Use of Your Home.\n\nThese forms are pretty daunting so you might want to find Tax Preparation software, make sure it can handle a small business.  Or you might want to go to a Tax Perparer like H&R block.  I recommend the later because they will know what deductions are legal and accepted by the I.R.S.4	Why do people blame viruses way to often? Why does people who are supposed to know a lot about computing blame everything on viruses?\n\nI hear it all the time. When people say they have a problem, describes their issue and ask for help. Techies just blame it on viruses and tells them to reinstall everything.\n\nBut WAY TO OFTEN it is not a virus, but a simple configuration error or missbehaving software that casues the error. So why oh why does everyone blame non escisting viruses all the time!? I do hope that you're referring to phone technicians.\n\nPersonally, I avoid telling customers to reinstall as much as possible. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should need to reformat their machine over a virus. Absolutely none.\n\nViruses are the easiest to blame though because everyone knows what a virus is. If a phone tech tells you that you have malware or spyware, it's going to raise a lot of questions from you about removing it that he may not be capable of answering.\n\nPhone techs are paid by the call btw, not by the answers given.9	Tell me more about Uyghur(Uighur) People? who they are?

I have 256mb ram and my computer seems to run very slowly. when i transfer files, or copy a file to one folder to another, my computer really crawls. I tried to format it but it has no used. Can it be the hard disk, maybe its broken or something, because i dont think it has something to do wtih the ram. What could be the problem If you are using internet then first of all try to clean temporary internet files by using Windows Explorer -> my computer - > drive c: -> windows -> temporary internet files.\n\n2nd step is remove all unnecessary programs/games from your computer. Remove means you must uninstall thats way it will remove its registries also.\n\n3rd. You can remove registries from \nControl Panel -> Add&remove programs (select properly the programs/games which is not necessary and you are not using or you may have lots of demo versions that is occupying space.\n\n4th run the disk defrag from system tools\n\nafter all these process.\n\nShutdown the computer completely and turn it on. You may see a difference.\n\nThanks.7	is anyone else as tired of hearing about tom cruise as i am?? or any other celebrity . who cares if hes gettting married there are hundreds of marriages every day.....and hey , when there are people starving and still suffering from hurricane katrina , the money he spent on this stupid wedding could have been used to helped dozens of families. thumbs down for tom cruise and his decadence. to me its just more proof that people with money are so far removed from the rest of us , and there are more of us than them.....

This is a question in the arenas of philosophy, psycology and sociology - not biology.  But, here's my opinion.  See also Popper and Kuhn (or is it Kuhne?)\nThe publishing process (assuming peer review - this is NOT always the case!) is intended to ask the tough questions about the way the data was obtained.  The peers are experts who have learned (the hard way) many of the pitfalls and errors which can cause errors in the data.  So, before the evidence is published there is usually several reviews of it (again this ignores the problem of prepublication and on-line publishing).  Some of the analysis attempts to be unbiased but some is clearly subjective.  That is, there is more tendency to accept for publication a paper if the author's name Albert Einstein than if it is Joeseph Stalin.  Pedigree is important.  Number of papers published, thesis advisor, number of citations, institutional affiliations, likeableness (really!), personal acquaintance, awards, prestige,and more all play a part.  Also data which confirms the reviewers opinions also has more tendency to be given a cursory review.\nGenerally the peer review process is expected to determine the quality of the data AND the quality of the interpretation, a most daunting task given that generally all that is known is on paper or in a file in front of the reviewer.  No video tapes of the Ah Hah! moment, no printouts of the calibration history, nothing about how the data was "really" acquired.  Thats why there is so much emphasis placed on the trust the editor and reviewers have of the author(s).  Thats why PhD diplomas are often a required part of the pedigree.  Error and fraud still slips through.  The recent S Korean stem cell fiasco, and the failure of the Atmospheric and Earth Science community to realize the OBVIOUS fact that data from satellites is biased if orbital decay is not fully accounted for.\nBoth of these failures were at the editorial peer review stage.  BUT!!\nAfter publication the REAL peer review begins.    Scientists are highly opinionated.  Any data contradicting their pet opinions will be (hopefully) subject to intense review.  Character assination, name calling and fist fights also happen, unfortunately.  The process goes as follows.  Paper is read.  Then the data is studied.  Perhaps questions to the author are sent, others are enlisted.  Sometimes more data or raw data is requested.  Visits to labs (if the scientists are still speaking to one another) are scheduled.  Attempts may be made to duplicate the data (not publishable, so IF it is done it is done with MS or undergraduate talent).  Additional experimentation is done based on the scientists analysis of the paper's implications or flaws or both.\nAt the same time Letters may be written to the Journal's Editors if the scientist believes that there is a substantial error in the paper be it in the data or (more often) in the interpretation.  Many times the Letter is a criticism that the author did not take into account other data (did not cite or address it).  Feelings are hurt, careers are made or broken.\nSo, to answer your question:\n1.  Scientists agree on some data - some of which is wrong\n2.  Scientists disagree on data - lots of which is right.\n3.  Scientists often suspend judgement on data (and interpretation) until there is a preponderance of evidence (data) which is consistent with that data (replication and/or confirmation of the same or similar results or additional experiments which rely on (or contradict) the interpretation (falsifiability) presented by the author).\n4.  Motivated scientists work to confirm or contradict the paper's interpretations, depending on which "side" they are on.3	the role of accountant in intellectual capital management?

We need to take the handcuffs off the troops we have there.  Since the insurgents are either foreign fighters or sunni baathists, we should be going thru the baathist areas, killing all males of fighting age.  Done right we could be out of Iraq in about 3 - 5 months.5	who sings torrie wilson's new theme song and what's it called?  Lillian Garcia - Need a Little Time2	What could be causing a shortness of breath? Sometimes I get short of breath for no reason.  When it happens, it's like I have to breath in a little bit deeper to feel like I'm getting enough air, but I don't have asthma because I don't wheeze.  I also tend to yawn more when it happens.  I don't get light-headed though, and it doesn't seem to be serious, but it's uncomfortable.  I'm just curious what causes it.  I haven't been able to find any patterns as to why it would occur.  Does anyone have any ideas? (By the way, I am physically fit.  In fact I'm a runner, but  it doesn't seem to be related to any type of exercise I do.) The yawning suggests you're not getting rid of the CO2 from your lungs very well, which also suggests that there's something strange going on.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Even though it's not bothering you much right now, go see a doctor about it.  It could be symptomatic of something serious that's brewing, and the sooner it's found the better.4	Why and why not do people buy things on the internet?

It has received Priority Review status and will be the only drug in a very large market.  Tomorrow it moves from the AMEX to the NASDAQ.  Should we keep our investment and take the slight risk with the chance for huge reward, or should we take the money off the table and have a modest retirement?

From your question, I can write 2 equations with 2 unknowns. Let x be the mls of 3% and y the mls of 15%. We know x+y=2500 and ,03x+.15y=.1(2500)=250ml. Substitute for x, since x=2500-y to get .03(2500-y)+.15y=250. Expanding and combining yields  75-.03y+.15y=250, then .12y=175, then y=175/.12 =1458+1/3, so x=1041+2/3.7	Do you want him as your lap-dog? http://static.flickr.com/113/288712560_1fa7718a6b_o.jpg <----He is soo cute Is a lap dog a lap dancer with paws?5	Does anyone know if Legends sports memorabilia Magazine stills exist? , i use to collect these magazines through subscription and was wondering\nif they still exist.

All of the new releases in music and movies come out on tuesday. do you know the reason? In itunes new music come out on tuesdays. Shelves of film stores and music stores get new stuff every tuesday...why is this? Actually, new movies come out on Friday. Albums and videos come out on Tuesday as a matter of tradition. It used to be that Arbitron tracked artist sales by calling record stores. By calling on Monday they knew they'd get weekend sales. Redcord companied wised up and started releasing on Tuesday to get a full week's worth of sales reported. Now, of course, it's all electronic, so "new release Tuesday" is just a tradition.0	Hence you are told to accept one god, is insinuating  that there are many gods? So is that saying there are many gods ,so then there must be a civilization of gods that again proves my alien theory about gods   \nOT that thou shalt not have no other Gods before me. And, Jesus said the only way to the Father is through the Son. I've heard that when Judaism originated, the Israelites regarded their god as their national god and recognised that other peoples had their own gods, but I'm not sure how true that is. I do find it interesting that in Genesis, when Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, god says, "Now he has become like one of US!" So it's possible that the Jews originally thought of pagan gods as real rivals to their god, rather than non-existent beings.2	why do u miss ur monthly some times if u not haveing a baby?

Wrestlemania The Biggest Stage Of Them All From Wrestlemania 1 To Wrestlemania 22 Which One Is Your Favorite And Why? WrestleMania.The super bowl of sports entertainment.A night where each wrestler goes out there and gives it their all.And that's exactly what happened at WrestleMania 12.March 31,1996 in Anaheim California.It was an important WrestleMania because it marked the last WrestleMania for WWE champions like Diesel better known as Kevin Nash,Yokozuna and Ultimate Warrior.It was also the last WrestleMania where Hall of Famer and undoubtedly the best heel of all-time Roddy Piper wrestled for the last time at WrestleMania.It was then that Steve Austin and the Game Triple H.Although, Austin was successful in beating Savio Vega.Triple H was easily squashed by The Warrior in less then 2 minutes.The Undertaker and Big Daddy Cool put on a wrestling clinic.Diesel had control throughout the match.He even managed to Jackknife Undertaker twice.But did not follow up.When he hit the third power bomb,he tried to go for a pin.As he bent down the Deadman caught him by the throat and chokeslammed him to the canvas.After a tombstone,it was all over for Big Daddy Cool.HBK vs Bret Hart is the best match of all time.Lets start with Shawn's entrance flying of the top of the building into the crowd.Even though,Bret should have retained the title.HBK won the WWE title at WrestleMania XII.Shawn also had a chance to win titles at WrestleMania X,XI and XX.All i can say,'It pays to patient'.Therefore,my favorite WrestleMania is WrestleMania XII.Hope you like my summary.2	Is there a cure for FMS (fibromyalgia)?  there is no known cure but through diet and supplements of antioxidants as well as b-12 (helps energy level) you mite have less bad days... research all that you can and then start your trial and error as to what works best for you... the fybromialgia site would be a good start... take care of yourself and rest often9	have you ever been unlawfully arrested? my brother was recently pulled over by traffic police cos they allege that he showed them da finger! he was handcuffed and thrown into the vehicle, then taken to the police station and released on warning-R100 fine....

I have been a migraine sufferer for years, Topamax has been a life saver! I neglected to remember it for my vacation (along with all my other meds...I felt like such a dope!) Anyways, I was getting ready to go on one of those 3-D thrill rides, you know where you wear the 3-D glasses and you sit in the chairs and they move the chairs around so you feel like you're in the movie. Anyways, I was standing up in line staring at the screen with my 3-D glasses on and all of a sudden it felt like my eyes were being squeezed together, I was suddenly very nauseous, and dizzy. I was very disoriented. I immediately removed the glasses and looked away from the screen. It was like a very sudden, intense migraine aura. It went away, but I didn't put those glasses back on! I've never experienced anything like it. I plan on discussing it with my neurologist, but unfortunately that appointment isn't until next month. Anyone else? If the screen was flashing you could possibly have migraines caused by the light.  I have a sensitivity to fluorescent lights and cannot stay under just that kind of light for more than an hour or so.  My neurologist said that the lights flash very quickly and it causes a reaction in the brain similar to epilepsy, but not on such a severe scale.  I would get terrible migraines and lose my short-term memory.

So far the mechanisms that lead to inclusion formation as well as their role in the pathogenesis of HD are not totally understood. However, it is well established that inclusion bodies contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Accordingly, it has been postulated that impairment of this machinery can be one of the causes of this disorder. In this review, the authors summarize the state of current knowledge about this hypothesis.0	Have you seen any ghost horses?please let me know.I am curios about it.DON"T BLAME ME I AM 9? please please!!!!!

However you will have to reinstall most of the programs seperately in the new computer.\n\nFollow these steps\n1. Run the wizard in your old computer.  If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option.  Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\n\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk.  Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\n\n3.

Every asst. manager job varies from property to property. It depends, mostly on the size of the property who does what. If it is a large property there is probably a leasing person to show apartments, answer phones, prepare lease files, do the filing and the correspondance. If the property is small that falls on the asst. manager to do.\n\nThe asst. manager covers for the manager, which is why they are called assistant managers. You screen calls, take care of the small problems that come in, handle walk in people,prepare newsletters and bulletins. Discuss decisions with the manager if they ask for input, make decisions when the manager is not available. You do basically whatever the manager asks you to do. Your job is to take the burden off the manager without acting like the manager. Or trying to take over the manager's job by second guessing the manager.\n\nThat's a very general description. Asst. managers are extremely difficult to find, good ones anyway. You are the most valuable person to the manager. Usually when the manager leaves, the asst. moves up to take the manager's position.0	babylon is nearer than you think? as we dither here on the computer, babylon is being rebuilt. if you know the signifigance in that, you must reasses your faith with GOD! if you dont, do it anyway Your thinking is the reason the world is in such dire straits!\n\nI saw a beast coming out of the sea.

I don't understand that because I thought that it was central to Islam that only God is to be worshipped.  Why is that any different for the angels?\nThanks. Remember, it is God who ordered them to bow. It was not a bow of worship, but a bow of honouring, respect, and to obey God's command, just as humans used to do to pay homage to someone. Here's the reason why God told them to bow.\n\n“[…] When your Lord told the angels, ‘I am putting a successor on earth,’ they said, ‘How can You put someone there who will cause damage and bloodshed when we celebrate Your praise and proclaim Your holiness?’ ” They asked this not out of objection, but simply to know why and to know whether they have fallen short of their duty in praising and worshipping God. “But He said, ‘I know things you do not.’ ” Then the angels thought to themselves, “Let our Lord create what He will. He will not create a being that is more honoured, or more knowledgeable than us.” They kept this thought of theirs a secret, but nothing can be hidden from God.\n\nThen, later, when God "taught Adam the names of all things, then He showed them to the angels and said, ‘Tell me the names of these if you truly think you can.’ They said, ‘May You be glorified! We have knowledge only of what You have taught us. You are the All Knowing and All Wise.’ Then He said, ‘Adam, tell them the names of these.’ When he told them their names, God said, ‘Did I not tell you that I know what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?’ ” God exposed the statement the angels kept to themselves  and showed them how Adam was in fact both more honoured (when they bowed to him) and more knowledgeable.\n\nHope this helps, Peace be with you.

Art bell is no one...\nWho told you he exist?\nDude how can a person who does not exist have a brain?\n\n\nI hate art bell you know why... Bcoz of his HATE LETTER TO THE FILIPINOS... Here read...\n\n-------------------------\n\nFilipinos.....*make me puke* (Art Bell)\n\nAs we've all come to notice, in the past few decades, Filipinos have begun to infest the United States like some sort of disease. Their extensive involvement in the U.S. Armed Forces is proof of the trashy kind of qualities all filipinos tend to exhibit on a regular basis. You can see this clearly by studying the attitudes and cultural Icons of most Filipino Americans.\n\nOrigins of Pinoys/Pinays: \n\nAre they really asian? Well we've come to accept the fact the filipinos come from a part of the world known as South East Asia. But the term "Asia" is used in the wrong way. You may notice that contemporary Filipino Americans try very hard to associate themselves with groups that we know as Asian. I cannot count the number of times I have seen a 'Third World' Filipino try to connect themselves to the chinese or Japanese people. There is no connection and here's why. The Philippines is a Third World country. Nothing respectable has EVER been created by Filipino people during our entire human history. Young filipino men in America have become obsessed with "import racing". They have an enormously perverted affection for Japanese cars. It's a common phenomenon. In their minds, these Filipinos somehow believe that they are asian and that it somehow connects them to Japanese people and japanese cars. They often take credit for the ingenuity of Japanese people and say how it's an "Asian thing". This term..."Asian thing" derived directly from African American slang "black thang". "It's a black thang." "It's an asian thang." \n\nYou can see the connection. It's even funnier that, in Japan, Filipinos are heavily discriminated against. The only filipinos that can live successfully in Japan are the filipino prostitutes. But that's the case for most Filipino people no matter where they live in th e world. Now we've come down to this fact...and it is a fact. \n\nNothing in Filipino Culture can be seen as Asian.\n\nThey have no architectural, artistic, or cultural influence which is in ANY way, asian. Thinking of the great countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and China there is no way you can possibly connect the Philippine Islands. This assault by filipino americans to connect themselves with the great peoples of North East Asia is foul and disgusting. Try visiting a young filipino's web site too. \n\nYou'll see something called the "Asian IRC Ring". It has to do with the chatrooms. The most horrible thing about this is that these TRASHY people are trying to associate themselves with Asia again!! People in Asia don't act like this at all. What we are seeing here is the natural Filipino in its element with full access to technology and this is how they act! You will consistently see this behavior over and over again. \n\nAnother interest ing thing is that these "thirdworld" people also frequent RC chatrooms such as #chinese #japan and #asian. They must believe that they are somehow related racially or culturally to North Asians. But it's completely WRONG! There might have been some distant contact With China and even less with Japan during World War II, but these people are actually more closely related to african americans and Mexican americans. \n\nDo the parents of these young filipinos know what's going on? Would they accept this? I believe that they would and do. This is the natural "Trash" element in filipinos manifesting itself. Nothing good has ever come from Philippines and I don't believe anything good ever will. \n\nRecognizing your Roots (A Message to Filipinos). To all filipino people: \nPleas4	Explain about the meaning of Hardware?  Hardware is hard1	Please Help Me to Solve This True and False Questions!? Please explain to me whether the statement below are true or false:\n1. If F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then y = F(x) is a solution to the\ndifferential equation dy/dx = f(x).\n2. If y =F(x) is a solution to the differential equation dy/dx = f(x),\nthen F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x)\n3. If an object has constant nonzero acceleration, then the position\nof the object as a function of time is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nI need the explanation too not only just the true or false answers.\n\nThanks for all the help! 1. This is true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nLet f be a continuous real function defined on a closed interval [a,b]. F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) means that F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x. Suppose there is x and x+h inside [a,b], we have F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x AND F(x+h) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h. The definition for dy/dx is such a limit on \n[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h in which h tends to zero. F(x+h)-F(x)= "Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h" MINUS "Integrate f(t) dt from a to x" which is EQUAL TO "Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h" According to mean value theorem, since f is continuos so is F, there exist a value c between [x,x+h] such that "Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h" EQUALS "f(c) h". Then [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h = f(c) h/h = f(c). When u tends h to zero, since c is squeezed between [x,x+h], c tends to x (sandwich theorem). Hence dy/dx = f(x).\nTherefore, from y=F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), you arrive at a conclusion dy/dx=f(x) which is equivalent to your question 1.\n\n2. This is also true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.(In fact this is a corollary(small truth following from the truth of a theorem, informally means small theorem)\n\nIf f(x) = F' (x) (ie dF(x)/dx). Therefore we know that limit h->0 for {[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h} is f(x). By mean value theorem, F'(c) = [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h for c in between [x,x+h]. {We assumed continuos function again, if not it doesnt work. In fact all your question means continuos function which is differential at all points within the function interval that we are interested in.} From f(x)= F'(x) we get f(c)=F'(c). Then you have F(x+h) = f(c)Xh + F(x). Since F(x+h) = f(c) h + F(x) for h tends to zero. Lets say we know that a certain initial value F(a). We want to find F(t) in the interval [a,x], then we can first start with F(a+h)=f(c) h + F(x) where c is between [a,a+h] and continue up till x. If we want to find F(x), it is just summation f(t) delta t, and if we limit delta x to zero, we get F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x  PLUS F(a), which is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\n3. x'' = k for k constant. Then x' = kt + C. x= k/2 * t^2 + Ct + D. Just do direct integration using statement 2.6	HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE GROUP CALLED KORN? wHAT IS YOUR FAV SONG?

One of the difficulties of looking at addictions within a "disease" model, is that from a rehabilitative point of view, it effectively absolves the person from any personal responsibility, as they have a "disease". Obviously, this is problematic in treatment, as it relies essentially on the person being motivated to change and taking some ownership of the problem, which is not the way the medical or disease model works. In medicine, things are done to people, i.e. they are treated, but when rehabilitating people with dependency issues, the opposite needs to happen, they need to take personal responsibility, otherwise they will go back to using. This is all part of an overall trend over the last 30 years, where medicine (and in particular, psychiatry) has attempted to classify what was previously seen as deviant behaviour and turn it into a "disease". It can be argued that this has led to modern psychiatry being more about social policing then actual treatment of mental health problems in the classic sense (such as schizophrenia, depression, etc.). However, as a final point, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that some people do have a physiological vulnerability to becoming addicted to some substances.

It's amazing to see what the world has accomplished these days. It would be awesome to see a space probe go to the Adromeda galaxy o sombrero galaxy. Though they are millions of lightyears away, our milky way galaxy will one day collide with the Adromeda galaxy. t would be amazing to have a space probe send back pictures. A probe going to another galaxy may indeed find life. It could also be inellegent. The only problem is that it would (with current and planned technology) take centuries for the probes to arrive.The fastest spacecraft we have today is the one heading for pluto. It will take ten years just to get there and that's in our own solar system. There may be life elsewhere even in our own galaxy. But there are literally billions of stars just in the Milky Way Galaxy. The cost of space flight will prohibit extensive exploration, at least for the forseeable future. As for the race of hypothetical beings, It is hard to imagine that with the randomness and sheer numbers of life on earth as an example, we'd find similar beings in terms of physical appearance.\nOne more issue would be the radiation damage a space probe would incur during a flight of this duration. Even a short time in space is damaging for complex and sensative objects (human and machine). Cosmic radiation floods space with sub-atomic particles traveling at or near the speed of light. Those particles pierce and pass through what ever it is they run into (except several very dense elements). The damage occurs to the probe on a microscopic level. The eletronics, computer chips and sensors begin to look like swiss cheese after enough exposure. There may be solutions to these problems in the future, but for now they are another prohibitive factor for extensive space exploration.2	I am trying to build muscle but i dont think im doing it correctly, diet, exercise ect. please help?

If you are in a long distance relationship, it can be very trying.  If the couple can be honest and loyal- it could work, but it seems that distance can make a person think lying is a better option, because they figure "who will find out?"  Ultimately, the whole point of a relationship is to be together, so unless the couple commits to moving or something- I wouldnt recommend starting one up.  It can really mess you up.\n\nOn the other hand if you meet someone far away, it can give you a chance to get to know a lot about each other before you meet face to face- could be good, or bad.  BUT long distance relationships will never last, because togetherness is the goal. Unless thats the KIND of relationship you BOTH want. Eventually someone will have to move closer, or forget about it!  If you move closer together it isnt a long distance relationship anymore, so whether you get together or not- the "long distance" relationship has to eventually end. ;)6	Trying 2 have info sent 2 me from colleges for being an LPN for Fl but cant find any know of any good places?

Clearly he is attempting to drag Latin America down into a leftwing socialist abyss of misery and despair.  Imagine how much suffering might have been spared humanity if Hitler was taken out before he conquered Europe. Socialism is a fraud.  Marx and Engels lived off inheritances; there are no traitors to that class, which is proved by the fact that socialists are such bossy snobs.  Aristocracy must be abolished.  Politics, as misrepresented by the choices given to Chavez, is just a food fight in a prep school.  Castro himself came from the upper class--until that automatically disqualifies him because people finally come to the realization that nothing but tyranny and incompetence comes from the spoiled, the South Americans will just bounce between rotten right-wing governments and rotten left-wing governments.  Chavez seems like a typical peasant who has to worship the rich, so when the rich offer this phony socialism he falls for it and the Venezuelans will sink.2	what is the exposure time for meningitis? we had a student come down with this this week SEE A DR> NOW>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nIt is VERY DANGEROUS and it has a span of 3 to 10 days, so you never know, unless you go to the emergency room or call your Dr. so they can make special arrangements so you will not be in contact with others.\nIT IS VERY CONTAGIOUS\nGOOOD LUCK, and GOD BLESS YOU5	who the next nistelrooy?if he gone?  they should get trade nistelrooy for torres in athletico madrid. the guys like 22 or 23 and hes their top goal scorer hes their most prized possession6	How many times are people going to ask "what's the meaning of life"?

KYOTO is relating to the CO2 emissions which countries emit, The majority of Europe has signed up to this agreement but the real harmful players have not. U.S.A for instance thinks it can battle global warming with technology and will not sign up to it and China has plans to build one coal fired power station every week for the next seven years so the real effects that KYOTO was intended to do will be offset by these two nations alone. I think it was a great idea and I am not a tree hugger or anything but I do beleive that the KYOTO agreement is the best way to go. The fact of the matter is that those countries which have signed up to it are not cutting their emissions by nearly enough anyway and our own government is giving it's big companies it's own ways to bypass their responsibilities in buying 'CO2 allowances' from other companies anyway, I can not help but think that this KYOTO agreement was doomed to failure the moment it was signed2	Is it safe to have Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery? My friend is over weight and is thinking about having Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Surgery but I'm afraid it may be dangerous. Have you or do you know of anyone that has had this surgery and it turned out okay? Only serious answers please, my friend is seriously considering this and I'm really afraid for him. I am a nurse and have heard of many people having this done. Sometimes there are complications but the rate for serious harm as in death is minimal.\n\nThey would have him on a low calorie intake for a week (have to lose a few kilos on that) before the surgery and then operate. \n\nThe only problem with LGBS is that once done it cant be reversed. They keep shrinking the stomach until you lose the weight needed but you can never go back to eating normal. \n\nUsually they drink soups or eat a couple of mouthfuls of food and thats all they can fit in their stomach before they are full. Its a different way of life. I suggest your friend talk to someone who has had it done and lost weight to see how dramatically their life has changed with their eating habits. (If you eat too much, they say you vommit) \n\nYes the weight loss is a blessing but does that benefit outweigh the loss of being able to eat a normal meal and fit comfortably in with a group of friends when you are socializing. \n\nCheers9	What are the laws on teen sex in Wisconsin?

In Wisconsin the law states that anyone who has sex with someone under 13 is guilty of first degree sexual assault and anyone who has sex with someone under 16 is guilty of second degree sexual assault. So, you must be 16 to legally have sex and cannot have sex with any younger teens.7	if you were a singer which song would you choose to be your first?  I used to sing professionally in a Top 40 band in the 80's. I wonder if you are speaking about in a performance setting. In that case, you always start with a fast, driving song to get the energy in the room up. As far as band sets go, this is the usual fare: 6 - 8 songs per 40 minute set (20 minute breaks in between) and a distribution of something like 2 slow, 4 -5 fast OR 1 slow, 4 - 6 fast depending on the songs used per set.  If you are doing a one number performance go for something very driving and energetic and meaty ........if you are doing 2 numbers start with the fast and end with a slow song. If doing 3 songs, do fast, slow, fast.  And save the very best for last. Whatever you do, make each song one that brings the house down and has the audience 'over the moon' with your performance.4	my blue bar at the bottom of screen is to big you cant see the time or the s on start at the left of my screen can any one help to make it smaller You need to adjust the physical size of the picture on your monitor.

That might mean that singularities can only form at the centre of the universe. This idea stems from the fact that the universe is constantly expanding and therefore moving.. and this movement causes equal and opposite forces to effect the gravitational moment on the singularity. Also the movement of matter has the effect of changing mass (at around and beyond the speed of light (thinking of planks constant))doesnt it? This would also effect the formatative stages of singularities. So what are the true environmental conditions for a singularity to form? Does anyone have any good guesses? The common picture of the universe as a big sphere of space with stars in is an inacurate proposal. It is simply given as a simple method to give an idea of the principles. Think of it as a dumbed down idea to allow people to start to get to grips with an idea that has much higher levels of complexity. The universe is not expanding into space... before the universe there was literally nothing (not even a void) and the universe isn't expanding into anything it is simply expanding. If you set off on a trip to the edge of the universe... even at faster than light speed you would not reach it, you would simply come back to where you began. The dimensions that we are limited to make the image of our universe relative to our movement the euivalent to that of moving over the surface of a sphere, but not through it - here no centre and no edge exists, yet expansion can still occur. \n\nThat doesn't really answer your question but hopefully clarifies some points raised in other answers3	Anyone ever tried to enroll at Dartmouth College?

Thank you for answering! i really need your help with this question! Every accident is a little different, but in theory, a few principles apply:\n\n1) The higher the combined speed of the vehicles, the greater the risk.\n2) The greater the "acceleration" (meaning rate of change in velocity, and includes "deceleration") of a vehicle, the more damage.\n3) The heavier vehicle or the one traveling faster will usually have an advantage.\n\nNow, we can analyze those principles further.  Point #1 combines the vehicle speeds (velocities).  If the vehicles are travelling in exactly opposite directions, this will be at the maximum of simply totalling the two vehicles' individual speeds.  If they are at any other tangent to each other, the math is a little trickier, but it won't be at the maximum when combined.  Point #2 shows that it is the _change_ in speed that causes damage.  From this principle, I would far rather not "bounce back," as this means I would have changed speed all the more.  To simply stop, means I have gone from, say, 60 to 0, or changed 60 mph.  To bounce back means I have gone from 60 to -20, or changed 80 mph (not necessarily those numbers, but you get the idea).  Point #3 is true because the heavier and/or faster vehicle will usually keep going, forcing the slower/lighter vehicle to reverse direction.  Therefore, one vehicle might go 60 to 10 mph (change  of 50) while the other went from 55 to -15 (change of 70).  Having said that, it would be pure foolishness to increase your speed before the accident, owing to principles #1 and #2.3	What is the orbit period for the moon Titan?

I would say maybe you hit a spot on your spine which is causing the numbness. Stress could be making your chest numb but I think it's more than that. Even though you/ve had an mri and x-rays done...sometimes they can't show the real culprit. I would advise to get some more opinions of other doctors, check medical websites...but definitely don't let this go. It could be serious nerve damage. If you hit certain spots on your spine, nerves that carry impulses to the brain malfunction and can't carry signals as well anymore giving you the feeling of numbness or tingling and can spread down your legs or arms.

In physics, a force is anything that causes a body with mass to accelerate--intuitively, a push or a pull. The net (or resultant) force is the sum of all the different forces acting on a body.\n\nQuantitatively, force is a vector quantity defined as the rate of change of momentum induced by the force, and therefore has a direction associated. The SI unit for force is the newton.\n\nExamples...\n\n- a person holding a dog by a rope experiences the force applied by the rope on his hand, and the cause for its pulling forward is the force transmitted by the rope.\n- while standing still gravity pulls downwards, but the floor pushes upwards, and the net force is zero.5	French fans, are you dissapointed with your team's performance yesterday ?

Someone already began "talking"about the Superbowl happening...\nThe media blew the whole thing up and made a big deal about it...\nIt was only a breast... America does have the LARGEST P*RN indystry in the whole wide world... To come down on Janet Jackson on that is just lame...\nAlmost everyone ignores Ms. Jackson now... While she recently release her new album 20 Y.O.\nBut because the way American Media treated Ms. Jackson most Americans believe she isn't good enough for the world...\n(Who made the rules?)\nAnyway... 20 Y.O. isn't selling that well... In my opinion not only because off the way American Media treated Ms Jackson but also because VIRGIN doesn't support Janet Jackson to the fullest... She might be on their label but her contract ended after this last album... They asked Ms Jackson to resign at Virgin but she doesn't want to...\nAnd now Virgin is giving her a hard time by not doing much promotion for 20 Y.O.\nOn her official forum it was mentioned that Ms Jackson paid a lot from her own pocket... Meaning for the promotion to Japan, France and several in US Ms Jackson paid for everything herself. The plane tickets, Hotels not only fer herself but also for all the dancers and... Well the whole crew who went with her to do promotions...\nJD has done a great job for her... He has done as many as he could to get her name out everywhere...\nBut Janet Jackson fights for her rights and stand her ground!!!\nShe has JD on her side,her family, her dancers and her fans...\n\nNo matter what every one is saying about her ...all negative stuff... Janet Jackson doesn't have to prove her talent anymore... She already has proven to be a strong FENOMANAL WOMAN years ago...\nShe never was a great singer... She might never be the best singer...

I'd think that they both come from the same root - they have the same origins.  Before you can stereotype, you need to know someone's identity.

Keeping in mind that not all stereotypes are negative, this is a nice way to link the two.1	wave interactions?  lift hand to about shoulder height & move hand side to side or back & forward about 6 times that is waveing4	I need Help with Powerpoint..? ok..in my book it says "Click Slide 1.

It proposes to increase security along the southern United States border with Mexico, allows long-time illegal immigrants to a path to citizenship under certain circumstances, and it proposes to increase the number of guest workers over and above those already present in the U.S. through a new "blue card" visa program. The sponsor of S. 2611 is Senator Arlen Specter, who introduced it on April 7, 2006. It was passed on May 25, 2006.\n\nThe House Bill (The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005) enforce border security and making illegal immigration a felony, also it Prohibit Aid to Illegal Immigrants.\n\nI have a problem with both bill, the senate bill put the illegal on a path to citizenship giving them the same requirement as the people who have done it the right way. (Ex, you have a visas after like 3 years you can get a green card and 6 years later citizenship, the least they could have is sugar coat it a little bit, something like 6 before you can get a green card, 12 years before citizenship and a $4,000 fined then maybe people would not call it amnesty) The house bill on the other hand is just talking about boarder (ex, we need more boarder agents, yes we do, we can not deal with boarder security only and forget about the millions of illegal, the house bill make illegally felony and they think that going to work, that’s is only going to make the illegal play hide and go seek with the government and we will be lucky if you catch 1 million of them with the house bill, now\n\nWhat bill is better for you and why? i think the house bill is better because the illegal immigrants shouldn't have the same rights as all of us citizens. i think that they should have to do it the right way or no way at all. it's not really fair for them to come into the country and expect all the things that citizens have if they're illegal. so the house bill would probably prevent alot of them from coming in. but i also think that the house bill might backfire. because there are some crazy people out there that like to break the law just to piss the government officials off.8	Given the following description, would you find me attractive?

FEDX UPS OR REGULAR POSTAL MAIL WHICH ONE OF THESE ARE MORE FASTER AND A MORE BETTER DELIVERY SERVICES Depends on one of two things....price, or priority. Meaning, do you want it there fast or do you want it there cheap? If you want fast, FedEx, UPS, DHL, and etc. can do things within a 24 hr. period if you're willing to spend the extra money. If you're shipping multiple items, these services will sometimes offer a discount. If you want cheap, go with the Postal service. Their rates are based primarily on weight of the package and where it's going. But most 1st class mail takes 2-5 business days to arrive at it's destination in the continental U.S. One exception to this rule pertains to the overnight services I mentioned. If you use their ground services, it can sometimes be cheaper than the Post Office if they're not travelling too far. Most items sent via UPS Ground for example reach their destination within 1-5 business days in the continental US. Hope this helps!2	Can I be allergic to heat from a radiator? I've had a bad "cold" for over a week even though I've been taking meds and caring for myself.  It's a fairly new apartment, and I've never lived anywhere that has heating from a radiator.  If I do have this, what can I do? No, you can't be allergic to heat from a radiator, but you could be allergic to something used on the radiator (such as paint or a cleaning solvent) that is activated when it heats up and releases into the area.\n\nIf not that, radiators have a different effect on the moisture levels in a room than most other forms of heat. You might want to check the humidity levels in your place as high or low levels of moisture in the air can exasperate cold-like symptoms.8	why women hid her eyes and get freaked out when she sees a penis, but claim she loves it during s.ex?

The Story of Mother's Day\n\nThe earliest Mother's Day celebrations can be traced back to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honor of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called "Mothering Sunday". Celebrated on the 4th Sunday of Lent (the 40 day period leading up to Easter*), "Mothering Sunday" honored the mothers of England. \n*(For more information on Lent/Easter check out - Easter on the Net)\nDuring this time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealthy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would have the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with their mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought along to provide a festive touch. \n\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout Europe the celebration changed to honor the "Mother Church" - the spiritual power that gave them life and protected them from harm. Over time the church festival blended with the Mothering Sunday celebration . People began honoring their mothers as well as the church.\n\nIn the United States Mother's Day was first suggested in 1872 by Julia Ward Howe (who wrote the words to the Battle hymn of the Republic) as a day dedicated to peace. Ms. Howe would hold organized Mother's Day meetings in Boston, Mass ever year. \n\nIn 1907 Ana Jarvis, from Philadelphia, began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day. Ms. Jarvis persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, West Virginia to celebrate Mother's Day on the second anniversary of her mother's death, the 2nd Sunday of May. By the next year Mother's Day was also celebrated in Philadelphia.\n\nMs. Jarvis and her supporters began to write to ministers, businessman, and politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day. It was successful as by 1911 Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. President Woodrow Wilson, in 1914, made the official announcement proclaiming Mother's Day as a national holiday that was to be held each year on the 2nd Sunday of May. \n\nWhile many countries of the world celebrate their own Mother's Day at different times throughout the year, there are some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium which also celebrate Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May.\n\n\nI hope this helps....\n\nDon4	can any one tell me serial no. for  (easy screen shot 1.0.0000)?

An emoticon, also called a smiley, is a sequence of ordinary printable ASCII characters, such as :-), ;o), ^_^ or :-(, or a small image, intended to represent a human facial expression and convey an emotion. Emoticons are a form of paralanguage commonly used in e-mail messages, in online bulletin boards, online forums, instant messengers, or in chat rooms, without them simple statements could be misinterpreted. Sometime during 1981, Scott Fahlman (now a Principle Research Scientist in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University), devised a scheme for encoding and conveying one's feelings in small text "glyphs" to overcome this frustration.\n\nLook up emoticon in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.The word emoticon is a portmanteau which popular etymology bases on emotion and icon. A similar portmanteau, verticon (based on vertical and (i?)con), is sometimes used when referring to the East Asian style of emoticon.\n\nThe smile is represented with a basic smiley :-). The colon represents the eyes, the hyphen is for the nose, and the parenthesis is for the mouth.\n\nMany variants exist with different symbols substituted for the basic ones. The symbol for the nose is often omitted, for example :) or ;). When the colon is replaced with the equals sign, =), the nose is almost always omitted (so one would not see =-), for example).1	Can someone give me a diagram of all the KIngdoms and all the phyla's classes, etc. etc. etc? for example, the knigdom animal: all the phyla under the kingdom ans for each phyla all the callasses and for all the classes....

Although two centuries old, Dalton's atomic theory remains valid in modern chemical thought.    Dalton's Atomic Theory:\n\n1) All matter is made of atoms. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.\n\n2) All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties\n\n3) Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms.\n\n4) A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms. \n \n\n\nModern atomic theory is, of course, a little more involved than Dalton's theory but the essence of Dalton's theory remains valid. Today we know that atoms can be destroyed via nuclear reactions but not by chemical reactions. Also, there are different kinds of atoms (differing by their masses) within an element that are known as "isotopes", but isotopes of an element have the same chemical properties.\n\nMany heretofore unexplained chemical phenomena were quickly explained by Dalton with his theory. Dalton's theory quickly became the theoretical foundation in chemistry.4	can someone track ur paaswors of screen names of emails and use them?  yes!!!! especially if they put a trojan in ur computer like netbus1	is the pupillary consensual response contralateral or ipsilateral? why would such a response be of significant value in this particular reflex?\nI have searched all over my book for this and cannot find answer.

These two dates have been dubbed "Black Thursday" and "Black Tuesday," respectively. On September 3, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 381.2. At the end of the market day on Thursday, October 24, the market was at 299.5 — a 21 percent decline from the high. On this day the market fell 33 points — a drop of 9 percent — on trading that was approximately three times the normal daily volume for the first nine months of the year. By all accounts, there was a selling panic. By November 13, 1929, the market had fallen to 199. By the time the crash was completed in 1932, following an unprecedentedly large economic depression, stocks had lost nearly 90 percent of their value. \n\nThe events of Black Thursday are normally defined to be the start of the stock market crash of 1929-1932, but the series of events leading to the crash started before that date. This article examines the causes of the 1929 stock market crash. While no consensus exists about its precise causes, the article will critique some arguments and support a preferred set of conclusions. It argues that one of the primary causes was the attempt by important people and the media to stop market speculators. A second probable cause was the great expansion of investment trusts, public utility holding companies, and the amount of margin buying, all of which fueled the purchase of public utility stocks, and drove up their prices. Public utilities, utility holding companies, and investment trusts were all highly levered using large amounts of debt and preferred stock. These factors seem to have set the stage for the triggering event. This sector was vulnerable to the arrival of bad news regarding utility regulation. In October 1929, the bad news arrived and utility stocks fell dramatically. After the utilities decreased in price, margin buyers had to sell and there was then panic selling of all stocks.0	Down low men, what do you think of them???  Australians?

No. Not all animals bleed red.\n\nWarm-blooded animals have red blood because they have the pigment hemoglobin.   Hemoglobin is the pigment in warm-blooded animals that carries oxygen molecules from the lungs throughout the body.\nHemoglobin is red, related to the iron atom at the center of the molecule.  \n\nInsect blood, for example, does not have hemoglobin, and is clear ... although it can appear green or yellow, most likely from chlorophyll from the plants it eats.  (Chlorophyll is the pigment in plants used for photosynthesis.)\n\nInterestingly, the chlorophyll molecule in plants is very similar to the hemoglobin.   The main difference is that chlorophyll has a magnesium atom in the center, rather than iron, and this is what makes chlorophyll green, while hemoglobin is red.9	Is Driving your Mustang GT convertable, into your living room,just before christmas a crime!!?

Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are mostly privately owned, and capital is invested in the production, distribution, and other trade of goods and services for profit in a market. These include factors of production such as land and other natural resources, labor and capital goods. Various theories have tried to explain what capitalism is, to justify or critique the private ownership of capital, to explain the operation of markets, and to guide the application or elimination of government regulation of property and markets.\n\nCommunism is an ideology that seeks to establish a future classless, stateless social organization, based upon common ownership of the means of production. It can be classified as a branch of the broader socialist movement. Early forms of human social organization have been described as 'primitive communism' by Marxists. However, communism as a political goal generally is a conjectured form of future social organization. There is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists, including Maoism, Trotskyism, council communism, Luxemburgism, anarchist communism, Christian communism, and various currents of left communism, which are generally the more widespread varieties. However, various offshoots of the Soviet (what critics call the 'Stalinist') and Maoist interpretations of Marxism-Leninism comprise a particular branch of communism that has the distinction of having been the primary driving force for communism in world politics during most of the 20th century. The competing branch of Trotskyism has not had such a distinction.\nKarl Marx held that society could not be transformed from the capitalist mode of production to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional period which Marx described as the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. The communist society Marx envisioned emerging from capitalism has never been implemented, and it remains theoretical; Marx, in fact, commented very little on what communist society would actually look like. However, the term 'Communism', especially when it is capitalized, is often used to refer to the political and economic regimes under communist parties that claimed to embody the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Marxist theories motivated socialist parties across Europe, although their policies later developed along the lines of "reforming" capitalism, rather than overthrowing it. The exception was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. One branch of this party, commonly known as the Bolsheviks and headed by Vladimir Lenin, succeeded in taking control of the country after the toppling of the Provisional Government in the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1918, this party changed its name to the Communist Party, thus establishing the contemporary distinction between communism and other trends of socialism.3	How many credit card purchases are made online per year?

So, if you need more or less calories, you need to adjust.\n\nIt really depends on the person's metabolism and activity level.  \n\nEven body type cannot determine how many calories a person needs each day. For example, a big guy may have a slow metabolism, and conversely, a small guy could have a high metabolism.  A person with higher metabolism needs more calories a day and vice-versa.\n\nAlso, the more active you are, the more calories you need.  Because, you will be burning up calories through your cardio exercises.  In addition, you probably have more lean muscle mass which burns calories as well.\n\nI personally aim for 2500-2700.  I have a fairly high metabolism and I am pretty active.7	Does anyone know of a site where i can find free sheet music? for a keyboard, can't find one. if you want to u can download kazza and u can get a whole lot of free music.just know the name and artist most of the time thats all you got to know5	What was the name of the famous female gymnast from the 80's- she was on Wheaties boxes...?

Is it inevitable that everyone who believes in a religion, believes that their religion is the true religion, and that all other religions are false? Is this just the ineviable battle of my God is real and yours is not?\n\nIs this what Romans and Greeks did?  Jupiter is real and Zeus is false God, Zeus is manmade religion? It is Ethnocentrism, as the Christian God isn't really a European God. He killed off the European Gods. (Sorry WASPS it's true)\n\nAnd no, this is not what the Greeks and Romans did. When the Greeks went into Egypt (There are writings still surviving) they said things like "There they call Demeter Isis" (Which was inaccurate, but that's not terribly relevent) and so they went ahead and worshipped her, and some called her Isis, and some called her Demeter. Likewise with the Romans, they said, "They also worship Jupiter, but they call him Zeus." They didn't run around saying "You have to call him Jupiter now, because Zeus is false." The folks who wanted to call him Zeus called him Zeus, and the folks who wanted to call him Jupiter called him Jupiter, but he was recognized as being the same guy.\n\nAnd for the record Mr. The-Bible-is-real-because-it's-got-real-places-in-it, there are lots of people, places and things that are verifiable by Archaeological and written historical evidence of the mythology of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, etc. So find yerself another argument.0	Have you embarked on the Pilgrimage that leads to Paradise? http://pilgrimage.answersformuslims.com/ Have you?

The effect of these particles when ingested into the body depends on the size shape and chemical nature of the particles. There are standard definitions used for dust based on the particle sizes as follows:\n\nTotal Inhalable Dust: This is the fraction of airborne particles which enters the nose and mouth during normal breathing. It is made up of particles of 100 microns diameter and less. This dust fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nThoracic Dust: This is the fraction approximately 10 microns diameter and less. This is also referred to as the PM10 in the USA. This fraction will pass through the nose and throat, and reach into the lungs.\n\nRespirable Dust: This fraction is the particles approximately 5 microns and less. It certainly penetrates into the gas exchange region of the lungs, and is therefore the most hazardous particulate size. This fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nDUST IN THE WORKPLACE: For many nuisance type dusts the occupational limits are around 10mg/m3 for total dusts and 5 mg/m3 for respirable or PM10 dusts. These are normally measured with small air sampling pumps running for a number of hours, or a quick measure of relative dust levels can be obtained by using a light scattering dust meter.\n\nDUST IN THE ENVIRONMENT (or AMBIENT DUST): In outside areas the levels are usually much lower than in enclosed working areas, but the acceptable levels of dust before they become a nuisance are also set at lower levels than for workplace areas. Because ambient levels are lower they are more difficult to measure. If sampling pumps are used they need to be much larger and run for longer periods in order to collect a weighable amount of dust on the filter. Sometimes a measure of dust deposits on a surface is used to determine the amount of environmental dust.\n\nPERMITTED DUST LEVELS vary in different jurisdictions, and will be lower for hazardous materials.\n AIR SAMPLING PUMPS: These are simple vacuum pumps which draw air through a pre-weighed filter at a fixed flow rate for a known time. The pumps need for run for a number of hours to collect a weighable amount of dust. The filter is re-weighed to determine how much dust is present in a known volume of air. These filters will only collect a few milligrams or less of dust - a very sensitive and expensive balance is required. The filter holder needs to be specially selected to collect the particle size range required - e.g. PM10 or respirable. The filter holders are often only designed to operate at a pre-defined flow rate -if they are to collect the required particle size range. Personal pumps normally operate at about 2 litres/min. Ambient pumps operate at higher level - from 10 l/min - even up to 500 l/min.\n\nDUST DEPOSIT GAUGES: These are used in the UK to monitor Dust Deposits. The Directional Dust Deposit Gaugeto BS.1747 does give some indication of monthly deposit levels in four compass directions. Very inexpensive.\n\nRECORDING MICROBALANCE: Very sensitive device produced by Ruprecht & Pasternicht (USA). A vibrating rod with filter on top. Dust is collected on the filter. The change in the frequency of rod vibration is a measure of mass of dust on the filter. Instant recording. Expensive.\n\nLIGHT SCATTERING DUST METERS: The trouble with Air Sampling Pumps is that the dust level they measure can only be a mean value for a measurement over several hours. Light Scattering Meters measure the light scattered by dust particles and can give an instant dust level measurement. Great care is required in using these. The number on the meter should be calibrated against measurements with an air sampling pump for your dust since they really measure scattered light - and the amount of light scattered by a particle depends on many factors, such as particle size distribution, density, reflectivity etc. NOT a true grav6	does anybody have any job openings I am going crazy?  openings are there.\nbut i doubt if there are any for people going crazy!!8	me and my girlfriend are close at times sometimes wo wont even talk to each other.? but we email each other all night about how we feel we are close to each other famalies. were always around each other but we just dont have anything to talk about. i be down her house she be down mine. we are always wresling with each other. everynite i walk her home hug her and ill give her a kiss an dtell her i love her but what can i do about the talkin problem become intersting in the things that she is and she should do the same. if you have common interests you should not have a problem finding things to talk about....the thing is, it's not a good sign that you have problems finding things to talk about.  i talk to my gf for 8 hours on the phone and we never run out of things to talk about....maybe you just need to get to know each other better and get closer.2	im 13 and got my period last summer its never been regular and i keep skippin when will i get a regular period Please help, i hate going into school and getting surprised! You're still young and you haven't had your period for that long.  Sometimes it takes a couple of years for your body to adjust itself.  Keep track of when you get your periods on a calendar or a pocket planner.  Mark how long you go for, then after you're done count 28 days from your last day and mark that day.  When you get close, pay attention and see how close you are to that.  Hopefully this will help guess when your next cycle will be.  And always keep some pads or tampons in your purse and backpack and locker so you have some available when you need them.  Don't worry about it too much.

I've stopped for a month now and really miss it.  I've got past the physical cravings and am no longer addicted but I've now realised how much I actually enjoyed it. Treat nicotine dependency recovery as if it were no different than alcoholism. Don't debate with yourself about wanting "a" cigarette. Instead, ask yourself how you'd feel about going back to your old level of consumption or greater,\n\nOnce in the heat of battle, it is normal for your mind to quickly forget many of the reasons that motivated you to quit smoking. Write yourself a loving reminder letter, carry it with you, and read it often. Make it your first line of defense - a motivational tool that you can pull out during moments of challenge. \n\nThe law of addiction states, "administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance at the old level of use or greater."

But adherence to this simple restatement of the law of addiction guarantees success to all ... no nicotine just one day at a time, Never Take Another Puff! \no5	Who is your favorite Texas Rangers player?

Pitching is the big problem. There are two major holes in the rotation. Moose was resigned so that covers one spot. Wang might go on to win the Cy Young this year so that's two.  Randy Johnson is an iffy third. Fourth and fifth are wide open. The Yanks did do the right thing and pick up a bunch of prospects. Now will they be patience a year or two while these guys develop? Few pitchers worth keeping are even good much less top notch the first 1-3 seasons in the rotation.  Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson,  Greg Maddux,  Curt Schilling and the list goes on. Look at the first couple years these guys pitched and you'll see lots of struggles going on. \n\nAs for Pettite, that would be a great pick up. Pettite has been the best stopper the Yanks have had year after year. A crucial part of the pennent drives. When the Yanks were in a losing streak it was always Pettite that broke it up. Also the only clutch pitcher the Yanks have had since Cone retired.  When the Yanks really needed it you could count on a good performance from Pettite. Might not be a shutout but Pettite was not going to get shelled. Not in an important game. He's come up with more than a few gems when it was most needed. \n\nWith Sheffield gone the Yanks need to move Giambi. That clears out the other steroid user and a huge contract.  Picking up Shelton from the Tigers might be a good idea. The Tigers obviously don't plan on playing Shelton. He carried the Tigers early in the year. Big problem with the Yanks are the team is too old. Teams as old as the Yankees are certain to suffer injury problems. They are rarely hungry. These guys all have their WS rings and some of them are just trying to finish off really good careers. Though Giambi doesn't have a WS ring for a reason. He's played on also rans his whole career and was supposed to be the spark plug to replace O'Niel.  He didn't either spark or produce his first couple years. After that he didn't have the credibility to be a clubhouse leader. The Yanks need a little fire, some motivation. Hungry players. 1b is a great place to pick up a young motivated player. So is at least the 5th spot in the rotation.  Abreu fits in nicely but he's a short term fix. His stats were declining in Philly. So he'll probably come up with one more good year then start to decline again. Possada as a catcher is getting way to old to count on. He's in injury territory in a very big way. The Yanks need him to start training his successor much the same way Gerlaldi taught Possada. Unlike Geraldi Possada if he transisitions before major injury can be an effective DH and 1b backup. The guy would hit 30+ HRs every year if he was not a catcher. He'd also probably add .010 to his BA. \n\nA-Rod in his worst season is the best 3b in baseball.  Last year he had MVP like numbers. This year only excellent numbers and people are upset?  Besides the fact only a few teams could afford that mega-mistake salary the Rangers made with A-Rod, would you really want to anger him? Trade him to a potential rival and motivate him to prove the Yankees were wrong?  It would come back and haunt the team. \n\nSo a starter or more starting prospects, a young 1b and a couple good catching prospects are what the Yankees need.  There is no quick fix lets get in the series this year kind of changes the Yanks can make. Picking up vets just means a replay of 06 and it's injuries. Bernie can cover DH if the new guys flop. Melky might be the answer or might be somebody else. Whatever the case he should get a serious audition. This is a good year for the Yanks to sort out prospects and aim for 08,09 and 2010 World series.  The Yanks can do a minor retooling this year and next or face a total rebuild in a couple years. Either way no WS.  \n\nBernie, Rivera, Abreu, Randy Johnson, Possada if he continues to catch, Moose are the big names who probably only have a couple good years left in them. Bernie is already probably playi0	Why are there so many inconsiderate people? I think that most (not all) people just care about themselves. They have this 'me first' mentality.  You have these inconsiderate pricks who have 20 items in the express lane or take their shopping cart and block the whole aisle. It is almost a miracle if you don't have someone cut you off or pull out in front of you when you are driving.

Work exposure to overheating may even impair fertility. \n\nSubstance Abuse\nCocaine or heavy marijuana use appears to temporarily reduce the number and quality of sperm by as much as 50%. Sperm actually have receptors for certain compounds in marijuana that resemble natural substances and which may impair the sperm's ability to swim and may also inhibit their ability to penetrate the egg. \n\nSmoking. \nSmoking impairs sperm count, sperm motility, reduces sperm lifespan, and may cause genetic changes that affect the offspring. Additionally, a 1999 study found that men who smoke have lower sex drives and less frequent sex. \n\nMalnutrition and Nutrient Deficiencies. \nDeficiencies in certain nutrients, such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc, and folate, may be particular risk factors for low sperm count in such cases. \n\nObesity. \nSome studies, but not all, have found an association between obesity in men and low sperm count.\n\nBicycling. \nBicycling has been linked to impotence in men and also may affect the sperm count. Pressure from the bike seat may damage blood vessels and nerves that are responsible for erections. Mountain biking, which involves riding on off-road terrain, exposes the perineum (the region between the scrotum and the anus) to more extreme shocks and vibrations and increases the risk for injuries to the scrotum. \n\nGenetic Factors \nGenetic factors are proving to be important contributors to male infertility. Such genetic conditions may be inherited or caused by environmental assaults. Inherited disorders can genetically impair fertility.\n\nEnvironmental Assaults \nOver exposure to environmental assaults (toxins, chemicals, infections) can reduce sperm count either by direct effects on testicular function or on the hormone systems, although the extent of the effect and specific environmental assaults involved are often controversial. Some chemicals that affect sperm production men are : Oxygen-Free Radicals, Estrogen emulation pesticidal chemicals (DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, PCPs, dioxins, and furans ), plastic softening chemicals like Phthalates, hydrocarbons (ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, and xylene)\n\nExposure to Heavy Metals. \nChronic exposure to heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, or arsenic may affect sperm production and most often cause a reduced production in otherwise healthy males. Trace amounts of these metals in semen seem to inhibit the function of enzymes contained in the acrosome, the membrane that covers the head of the sperm. \n\nRadiation Treatment. \nRadiation treatments and x-rays affect any rapidly dividing cell, so cells that produce sperm are quite sensitive to radiation damage. Cells exposed to significant levels of radiation may take up to two years to resume normal sperm production, and, in severe circumstances, may never recover. \n\nLow Semen Levels \nA reduced amount of ejaculated semen (less than 0.5 milliliters per sample) may be caused by a structural abnormality in the tubes transporting the sperm. \n\nVaricocele\nA varicocele is a varicose vein in the cord that connects to the testicle. (A varicose vein is one that is abnormally enlarged and twisted.) Varicoceles are found in 15% to 20% of all men and in 25% to 40% of infertile men. It is not clear how they affect fertility, or even if they do at all.4	I am a novice web designer, would I or client pay the web hosting fee?  If you area novice web designer then I agree with what most people say here, the client pays.  In fact, I would not even disguise it in your prices, have them establish the service and then provide you the administrator/anonymous FTP access.  I think the going rate for novice development of web pages in my area (Texas) is $50 per page.  A web designer should get in and get out, which means no continuing requirements with web hosting fees. If, on the other hand, you are a web administrator, then you are talking more long term commitment. The only way I would suggest holding onto the hosting fees if you lease a presence on the web and sub-divide that presence among your clients. Many ISPs allow that and you collect the aggregate coin and pay the one flat rate to the ISP.  It's up to you, but novice should stay simple.1	line of time of antidepressives?

You go to the office, a tube is inserted into your lubricated rectum, warm water is sent into your colon through the tube.  Then the water is released.  This is repeated for 45 minutes to an hour.  The water loosens up encrusted fecal matter in your colon so that your body can get rid of it.\n\nIt is very important that you research whomever will treat you.  In the States the procedure is licensed as a "cosmetic" procedure.  Ask the therapist lots of questions.\n\nFind out how long they've been in practice, what's the average number of treatments given to their clients.  Do they provide you with dietary education throughout the process or are you left on your own to figure out what to eat?  Check out the office.  Is it clean?  Do they reuse speculum's or do they use fresh ones each time?\n\nIf their clients come in continuously for more than 2 months (max 3) at a time, or if their clients only come in once in a great while for one treatment, look for another therapist.  The goal of the treatment should be to clean you out and to strengthen your bowels to do the work more efficiently on their own.  If the therapist wants you to keep coming in for months and months and months at a time, your body will become lazy and instead of strengthening your bowels, they will become weakened.\n\nI wish you well!1	What would happen if an irresistable force met an immovable object, and Chuck Norris was in the middle?

Seems my fiance & I are more tired then usual as we approach the fall season. Does anyone know if there is a medical reason for this? Its the change in the amount of light we get each day, its less during the fall and winter.  Some people also have condition called seasonal affect disorder where they become tired, depressed and sometimes anxious. This is also associated with the amount of light we are exposed to during the fall and winter. Try to get outside more if this isn't possible try going to a tanning booth.  If your worried about the damage from tanning booths use a good sun block and only stay in the booth for a short time 3 to 4 minutes your not looking to get tanned just to get the benifits of the extra light.  There are also special lights you can buy and sit under for 20 minutes a day.  They are expensive though usually around  $400.00  hope this helps.2	is there a company that i can purchase prison inmate items and ship to them?

I'm doing a report for school, and need some mmore information. Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \n\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \n\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \n\n \nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. "I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron," she wrote later in her autobiography. \n\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \n\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, "My Day." \n\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: "...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...." \n\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: "the story is over." Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.8	Doea Anyone have ideas for Dora The Explorer Partyies for little Girls? Invites, Favors, Food?

Most of the water soluble vitamins will be taken out of your body by your kidneys.

A zymogram is a strip or band of electrophoretic medium showing the pattern of enzymes or isoenzymes after their separation by electrophoresis.\n\nZymography is an electrophoretic technique, based on SDS-PAGE, that includes a substrate copolymerised with the polyacrylamide gel, for the detection of enzyme activity. Samples are prepared in the standard SDS-PAGE treatment buffer but without boiling, and without a reducing agent. Following electrophoresis, the SDS is removed from the gel (or zymogram) by incubation in unbuffered Triton X-100, followed by incubation in an appropriate digestion buffer, for an optimised length of time at 37?C. The zymogram is subsequently stained (commonly with Amido Black or Coomassie Brilliant Blue), and areas of digestion appear as clear bands against a darkly stained background where the substrate has been degraded by the enzyme.9	democrate or republican? r u a democrate or republican and y?

If me and my friend are just sitting in our car and we have stuff locked in our glove box, are cops allowed to take the car keys and open it if they think they have a decent reason todo so? Boy. There are a lot of people answering this question who really don't know the rules in this country. I speak from 11 years of law enforcement experience, many of those specifically developing traffic offenses into greater crimes. So people don't think I am feeding you a line of police BS, I included the laws that established each of the rights and reasons to search. Feel free to research them yourself so you can see I am giving you the straight scoop.\n\nThere are many times when the police can search your entire car, including your trunk, glove box, and even locked containers within your car, without a warrant. I'll lay out four of the most common techniques I use to search cars.\n\n(1) Consent. Can't go wrong here. If you ask for consent to search and the driver (or person in charge of the vehicle) gives you consent, you can search the entire vehicle. The consenting party has the authority to withdraw their consent and/or limit the areas you can search.\n\nOn reasons (2) through (4) consent makes no difference. If the police can meet one of these requirements, they will legally search your car with or without your consent.\n\n(2) Probable Cause. If you develop probable cause during a traffic stop, you may search the vehicle without a warrant. This is commonly called the "motor vehicle exception" to the search warrant rule. The authority for the police to do so was first established under a US supreme court case called Carroll v. United States. The courts have since expanded on this case and allowed the police to search items within the vehicle regardless of who claims ownership of the items. Under this technique, the police can only search areas where it is reasonable to believe the contraband they are searching for may be found. For example, if the police believe they are lookng for a rifle, they would not be able to search a purse. However, if they find the rifle and now believe they might be looking ammunition, the search of the purse is good.\n\n(3) Pursuant to arrest. If the police arrest you for a bookable offense while operating a motor vehicle, they may search the areas under your control (including the passenger compartment and possibly other areas of the car) for contraband or weapons that you may have discarded. This authority is established under case law named Chimel v. California.\n\n(4) Inventory search - If the police have the authority to tow your car, they may search it under the premise that they need to inventory all items contained within the car prior to towing the car. These searches were upheld under the community caretaking doctrine established under South Dakota v. Opperman.\n\nThere are other ways to get into a car. Too many to go into here. Truthfully, there is almost NEVER a time when the police need a warrant to search a car. In my 11 years, I think I have obtained a warrant for two or three of the probably 1000 cars I have searched, and those cars were firmly secured in the police impound lot pending the warrant.1	7 day weather forecast for hoi an vietnam?  weather.com9	Are the mexicans?

I had a reading done by someone that I really don't whether to trust or not. He said that I will be quitting the barber business and getting into something else. I was wondering, when and what do you see me doing instead of barbering? Because I'm not trained to do anything else that I could make enough money for my family to live on. I could go to night school, but I am clueless as to know what direction to go. thank you! Hi!\nHe is a fake and the money you paid went to his addiction.\nI am afraid you will be barbering for a while longer. I see you taking care of people as a nurse's aid actually.\nI also see you working with small children in a daycare center.

This may be something that you may have to fight for, possibly even hire an attorney if need be.  I'm not sure as to the particulars of your situation, so I couldn't really tell you whether or not you SHOULD get disability retirement.  Definitely go through the ranks until you get an answer...that's your best bet.8	I have been married 38 years. But for the past 15 have had no 'feelings' for my spouse. What do I do? My spouse spends most of his time away from home. He sometimes is gone for 8-10 hours after his shift is over at work. I know he helps his parents on occasion but 8 to 10 hours on a daily basis?? I want to get out so bad. But I am afraid. The unknown is always scary. Something took a wrong turn 15 years ago, and you haven't been on track since then. You  probably feel like your all alone in the woods now. So prepare yourself mentally to leave so you can physically leave or fix this! You have 2 choices. 38 years is a long time. I believe the magic that brought you two together is still alive, although it may seem like a candle in the sun. If either one of you had wanted to really end this, one of you would be long gone. But your both still co-excisting in the same home.  First, find yourselve again. If your job can't support you if you should decide to leave, use this time to find another job. Keep in mind, he is going to have to 1/2 things with you. So your probably going to be alright financially from the divorce settlement, if you go this route. Next you need friends. Don't sit at that house wondering what he is doing 8 to 10 hours on a daily basis. That is 8 to 10 hours that you have, to do anything you want. This is all about you now. You can't make him be happy. You can't make him come home after work, and probably really don't want to at this point. Stop doing the norm!!! Never ask him again, where he has been. You no longer care. You are  mentally prepping yourself for a better life. Now, keep in mind, once you are centered, he is going to notice the difference. They always do. At this point, you can try and rekindle or you continue to move ahead with your mental plan. What ever it is you decide to do, just get started on it as soon as possible. Woman, you are in the prime of your life! You have a lot to offer someone that will appreciate you. People live so much longer these days, and happy people make living longer even better. You come out of that house, re-enter the world of the living, get with friends, go to dinner, shopping, or take a singles vacation. Whatever it is, just do it! After about 6 months from now, you are going to be a new person. You are going to be a happier person. You are going to be alive and enjoying new things. You just refocus from who you where, and turn it around to who you want to be. You are going to be living each day for you. And if your husband wants to be apart of all this wonderful stuff, he can mentally change just like you are going to. If he is not a part of this plan, that is OK to, because in time you will mentally know you can carry on with out him. Good Luck, and God bless you and your determination.8	Suggestions needed for a wedding gift for my sister!!!!!? I am out of ideas....I dunno what I shud gift my sis on her wedding.

The word CARNIVORE can be used as a taxonomy term (order of mammals) or a diet term......but....\n\nNo, skunks are CARNIVORES and have very sharp canines to tear flesh.  Many carnivores (by their taxonomy) however may be able to eat plants too and are called omnivores.  Bears, like skunks, have very sharp canines, eat flesh, but also can eat berries, etc, so they are omnivores by diet. Our dogs and cats are also carnivores by taxonomy, but their diet is omnivorous esp since the pet food industry adds all sorts of veggies to the pet food. Left wild, undomesticated, many cats and dogs in the wild would perhaps hunt a lot more and eat more meat.\n\nAlso rodent taxon is not a family.  Families end in -dae letters in the latinized term. Rodents are famous for their enlarged incisors that allow them to chisel-gnaw at their foods, typically vegetarian-herbivore. They do not have the emphasized canines found in carnivores.2	why do we have armpit hair?

There are many unfortunate children in this world who do not get mother's love inspite of having their own mother.There are many woman who are more intersted in money matters ,job,parties etc. than taking care of their own children.At times we come across wicked mothers who use slangs in their house and teach their kids politics,witchcraft.Instead of teaching moral values they ask their kids to be dishonest to others,jelous of others.They always try to confine their children's future into darkness,limited to her guide-lines so that she can have full control and vigil when they grow up,so that they only follow her instructions even when they grow up.In that case if some other lady showers love on that \ndeprived child,is she not worth to be recalled as that childs mother? No, it does not always justify a mother/child relationship. If there is some other lady, unfortunately they have a very hard time, if not impossible, being "mom" because they are not the genetic mother who is there all the time.

Do you mean Upton Sinclair?\n\nUpton Sinclair, Writer  \n\n    * Born: 20 September 1878\n    * Birthplace: Baltimore, Maryland\n    * Died: 25 November 1968\n    * Best Known As: Socialist author of 1906's The Jungle\n\nUpton Beall Sinclair was a prolific American writer known for his affiliation with socialism and famous for his 1906 novel, The Jungle. Sinclair was born in Baltimore, but his family moved to New York when he was a child. When he was a teenager he began writing brief bits for newspapers and magazines. The Jungle was his sixth novel, and its success made him nationally famous. An exposé of the Chicago meatpacking industry, the book helped change national regulations on food preparation and earned him enough money to establish the Helicon Home Colony, a socialist community in New Jersey. Although the community only lasted about a year (it burned down in 1907), Sinclair remained committed to social causes and to exposing the dangerous effects of capitalism in realistic fiction, essays and various other writings. In 1915 he moved to California, where he ran unsuccessfully for public office several times, including running for governor as a Democrat in 1934. In the 1940s Sinclair again had popular success with the "Lanny Budd" series of novels, beginning with World's End (1940) and including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dragon's Teeth (1942). In 1953 Sinclair moved to Arizona, where he continued to write books, including working his 1932 autobiography, American Outpost, into The Autobiography of Upton Sinclair (1962).\n\nHe is not related to Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\n\nFOUR GOOD LINKS\n\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Good general summary of his career\n    * The California EPIC Movement, 1934\n      Historical pieces about Sinclair's bid for governor\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Letters from Jack London and the text of The Jungle\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Hyperlinked biographical essay1	Spectrophotometry of leaf extract? I have completed a spectrophotometry practical and calculated concentrations of leaf pigments as the following values:\nchlorophyl a    16.41 micrograms cm-3\nchlorophyl b     11.7  micrograms cm-3\nprotochlorophyllide   4.4  micrograms cm-3\n\nApparently the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b should be 3:1  but my results are giving me a ratio of 1.4:1\nCan anyone tell me if the wavelengths at which the solution was measured could have affected the results?\n\nWe were told to measure at wavelengths of 663nm  645nm   and 626nm as these are the red wavelengths at which maximum absorption occurs for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and protochlorophyllide respectively.\n\nHowever I also have information that states maximum absorption of blue wavelengths as being 420nm for chlorophyll a and 435nm\nfor chlorophyll b.  Is this of relevance to my answer????\n\nI have lots of reasons as to how inaccuracies with how the equipment was used could have affected my results Chlorophyl being green absorbs both red and blue light. There will be a peak in absorbance in both red and blue regions. I think your measuring wavelengths are too close together and you will need some way to compensate for the overlap of the absorbances of the 3 compounds.1	is Elgaland-Vargaland a country?  what are you on?!!!!..... not this planet1	What state pays geologist the  most money?

I recently tried fishing while on holiday with a new telescopic rod I bought. I found trying to cast out impossible, even with a weight on the end of the line. The line would get caught, or just tangle up. It looked so easy when others do it. Is there a knack?or do I have a crap reel. In the end I had to just lower the line down into the water over where I was sitting. Ryan G makes a very good point when using a telescoping fishing rod. It's very easy to get your line wrapped around the rod unintentionally.\nOther than that you should check to see that your line is wound properly onto the spool and not tangled onto interior working parts. This happens often on spin-cast reels that are spooled with too much line.\nWhen reeling in your line keep a slight pressure on it by holding it between your fingers. It helps the line to spool evenly and helps detect light bites.\n\nBest of luck.2	how 2 have a fair skin in less than 3 months? pllss tell me wat i shud do Accept your skin as it is, it's going to be a lot cheper than any cream ...0	is someone here a filipino race or descent?  im 65% filipino...\nwhy you wanna know?6	What would you do if you had a friend that screwed up every friendship u've had since you went to that scool ? tell her to find real friends and to stop ruining mine or deal with it Bring it up to them, and ask them why exactly are they doing that to you?

On average, I get about 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night. \nMy eyes still feel sleepy throughout the day. \nTake a 2 hour nap in the evening.\nGo to bed around 2am and sleep til late morning. \nRepeat cycle. \n\nI don't have a hectic life. I've walk about 30 minutes daily as excercise. I'm eating healthier. But I still feel so tired all the time. Could it be it's because right now I'm really bored and unmotivated with my life? Or is it something more physical? \n\nThanks. You said that you're bored and unmotivated with your life, so possibly it's a mild case of depression...?  If you think that may be the case, you should consult your physician.\n\nIf you don't think you're dealing with depression, making the following changes might help you feel more awake:\n\n1) Don't take a nap in the late afternoon or evening (probably not past about 3 PM); If you absolutely need to nap, limit it to a simple power nap of about 20 minutes.\n\n2) If you drink a lot of caffeine, cut back (or maybe even stop drinking it all together).\n\n3) Work out harder and for a longer period of time (and finish at least 2-3 hours before your bed time).  It will probably help you fall asleep and stay asleep better.\n\n4) Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n\n5) If you're waking up throughout the night or not feeling rested after 7-8 hours of straight sleep, you might want to think about replacing your mattress.  (This one was the one that helped me start sleeping better and feeling less tired).\n\n6) Expose yourself to more natural light.  Physiologically speaking, your internal (circadian) clock should respond to the difference in light throughout the day, making you more sleepy the darker it becomes and more awake the lighter it becomes.\n\n7) Create a sleep-time ritual for yourself.  The last half hour or hour before you want to go to sleep, make your space more quiet, warm, and inviting.  Cut out as many distractions as possible in that time frame -- turn off the TV or stereo and turn off unnecessary lights.  Slip into comfy PJ's.  This way, your body will begin to recognize when it is time to go into a sleep mode.\n\n8) Don't use a snooze button on your alarm.  You won't get any restful sleep if you wake yourself up every 10 minutes with a loud buzz.\n\n9) Don't eat within 2 hours of your bed time.  If you get the munchies in that timeframe, make yourself something like a hot glass of tea with a lemon wedge instead.\n\n10) In addition to eating a healthy diet, take a daily multi-vitamin to ensure that you're body is getting the nutrients it needs.\n\nIf these don't help, talk to a doctor -- s/he would be able to run tests to detect if you have an underlying problem causing the sleepiness.\n\nGood luck!2	how do u know if a girl likes u likes u?

I read over alot of the other answers and none of them describe me, so Im gonna explain why I do drugs (Im 17). \n\nI'll start by saying that I dont do stupid drugs like crack or meth, that destroy your body and leave you hooked. The drugs I use are pot, acid, magic mushrooms, occasionally opium, salvia divinorum, and i smoke cigarettes.\n\nI use drugs not because I think its "cool" or because I was pressured into doing any. I use drugs for meditation and mind expansion for the most part. Someone who has never tried acid or shrooms wont really understand when I tell them how amazing mind expansion is. Pot I use for meditation mostly, it takes concentration, but I've gotten good at it. As a result of my experiences with drugs and meditation I've reached a level of inner peace and happiness that I'd never before thought possible. I'm not saying you cant do this without drugs, but it makes it somewhat easier. And I dont need to be high all the time either to feel that effect. \n\nAnd of course I do get high for the occasional party or whatever. No big deal. As long as you know what youre doing and youre careful, everythings just fine.\n\nPeace7	Was anyone allowed to call Mr Rogers "Fred"?  Not on the show.

It's usually sharable, so multiple instances of a program can share the text segment to lower memory requirements. This segment is usually marked read-only so a program can't modify its own instructions. \nInitialized Data Segment: This segment contains global variables which are initialized by the programmer. \nUninitialized Data Segment: Also named "bss" (block started by symbol) which was an operator used by an old assembler. This segment contains uninitialized global variables. All variables in this segment are initialized to 0 or NULL pointers before the program begins to execute. \nThe stack: The stack is a collection of stack frames which will be described in the next section. When a new frame needs to be added (as a result of a newly called function), the stack grows downward. \nThe heap: Most dynamic memory, whether requested via C's malloc() and friends or C++'s new is doled out to the program from the heap. The C library also gets dynamic memory for its own personal workspace from the heap as well. As more memory is requested "on the fly", the heap grows upward.\n\nHope this would be clear.7	tell me yugioh cards that r needed in a very veryvery good deck.? please it is very needed first anser gets the best answer which is 10 points Use stuff like first very weak monsters up to lvl3.

It is usually caused by bacterial infection.\n\n\nIn gemology\nA carbuncle is a term for a convex, unfaceted, deep-red garnet.\n\n\nIn the Bible\nThe word carbuncle occurs in three places in most translations of the Bible. Each use originates from the same Hebrew word בָּרְקַת בָּרְקַת or bâreqath bâreqath (baw-reh'-keth, baw-rek-ath'). In this sense, a carbuncle is usually taken to mean a gem, particularly a deep-red garnet, unfaceted and convex; however, the Hebrew definition is less definite and the precise color of the gems is not known.7	beatsgreets.com? its a greeting card website it's egreetings.com now. but if you type beatgreets.com you will still get there. but you have to spell it right.0	how can i serve GOD and live a normal life?Is masterbation a sin?  Serve God by doing what Jesus would do. Is masterbation a sin, if it involves lust then yes. Jesus said whoever looks at a women to lust after her has commited adultery with her in his heart. Obviously every man struggles with it. But its better to mess up and confess you are wrong, then say nothing wrong with it. Of course you need to overcome it, because it is an addiction and the body will never become satisfied. Just remember we will face God one day. So its best you do what you conscience tells you.9	why do i want to be the next hitler?  Teeny Tiny Brain??2	How do people hear voices? I work with people with mental health illnesses, and I just wondered, when someone says they are hearing voices, are they hearing them like i hear someone talk to me, or is different, i knwo the question is vague, but i cant explain it properly..the same goes for seeing things, do tey see them like how i can see my friend sitting next to me? or is it different. Hi if you type into your browser "hearing voices mental health" You will get a whole range of sites to choose from which maybe of some help to you.  \n\nI work as a Senior within a care home for the elderly and they all have mental health issues.  \n\nThe term "hearing voices"....... they dont actually hear someone talking to them like you would hear me talking to you if i was stood infront of you.  They hear these voices in their inner ear.  The voice can be from someone they know (who maybe still alive) and from someone they have lost.  It can also be a voice of a complete stranger.  This is abit like when our consious self tells us within that something is wrong or that we need to do something, but for these people they hear it NOT as their own but as someone else telling them what to do or just talking in general.\n\nSome of my service users will spend hours holding a conversation with someone who isnt there.  They will even pause as if stopping to let the inner voice reply. Then continue as if answering them.\n\nI have recently completed a course on mental heath and I learned that even for something as simple as spotted flecks in a carpet can look competly different to someone suffering from mental health issues.  A few of our service users would bend over and reach for the floor trying to pick things up that werent there.  Even talking to the floor as if a small animal was there.  This I learned was because the flecks in the carpet didnt appear as flecks to them.  They saw it as something else and this all depended on the indiviual.  Weve recently had a new carpet laid now.\n\nIf your in thissort of work and not had previous experience your company should really be sending you on courses to help give you this knowledge.  People with mental health issues may see and there things but they are still very bright.  They will see themselves as being normal, and its YOU with the problem.\n\nSpeak to your emplyer about courses hun.  It must be very scarey for you at times.  Ive worked with mental health now for 4 years and im still learning new things everyday.\n\nAs abit of advice......dont turn it into a joke with someone if they start talking funny or telling you someones there its not likly to turn out very well.  You can try ASKING them who they see or hear.  You can sometimes understand them more if they feel you want to understand and can be trusted.  If you feel a moment is getting abit heated try and dirvert there attention somewhere else.  If your in their home on your own ALWAYS make sure you keep the exit door behind you.  NEVER let the client be between you and the door.  If a moment becomes above what you can handle or you feel you need some air then you can exit quietly and easily.\n\nAnything your worried about email me arabsaigold@hotmail.com.   I will be happy to help you ok4	"how can I clean up my notebook of viroses without paying ? I do not have acredit card".?  Hi there,\n\nThe best advice would be to download a free trial of a product called Prevx1. This currently offers the strongest protection and removal capabilities of any security product available, and also won't cost you a thing!\n\nYou can read more about Prevx1 and/or download their Free Trial here: (Simply click on "Infected?")\nhttp://www.prevx.com\n\nAlso - Please Avoid AVG at all costs  This really is an waful program, now offering one of the lowest protection scores of all security programs, with newer viruses waltzing straight through their defences. It's free for a reason, and that's because it's protection is lacking. I recently installed Prevx1 on a friends computer who already had AVG - and Prevx1 went on to remove over 30 viruses AVG had completely missed. Quite shocking really and I wish people would stop recommending it...\n\nGood Luck8	LoVe Me??????

The "adelphia" is anachronistic for a municipality.  So, the definition of Philadephia is "City of Brotherly Love."  It is more than just a motto (e.g., the Windy City in Chicago)--it is truly a definition or meaning.1	Will wild animals mate with siblings and parents? I was watching a pregnant wild cat out a window and commented on the fact that the brother could be the father of her kittens and my uncle said that siblings don't mate in any wild animal species.  I believe they do.  Any help would be appreciated. They will if they are near each other when the female is in heat or looking for a mate.  This is one reason why most animals have an in-built tendency to leave the family group when they mature.\n\nIn some animals, the young disperse as far as possible, thus avoiding their siblings.  In many herd species, the males are forced out of the herd when they reach maturity, sometimes forming their own small herds until they can find a new herd full of new blood that they can join.\n\nWhen dispersal routes are blocked by human development, or when populations get low enough that there is little choice in mate selection, incestuous breeding does indeed occur.  In many parts of Africa, the cheetahs are now so inbred that a skin graft taken from one cheetah can be put on another cheetah with virtually no chance of rejection.  There is so little genetic variance that they are nearly clones of each other.5	The Texas Longhorns lost,how did that happen?

What is this and should it be zero?  Basophils are a group of white blood cells which are normally in charge of producing immunoglobulins related to allergic reactions. Their numbers are the least among all white cells (about 100 to 200 per cubic mm of blood). SOmetimes blood tests aren't sensitive enough to detect circulating levels of basophils (they may be residing in certain other tissues in your body), and thus the absolute basophil count may turn out as zero. So don't be too worried about it; if the other indices in your blood work are normal, there shouldn't be a problem.6	looking for a 57" tv stand? 27"d 15"h 57"l make one!0	HeLP!!!!!!!!!!!?

Some experts argue that it's a set of behavioural characteristics and not a medical condition at all.\n\nAlso, it is usually treated with a class of drugs – psychostimulants – that are considered to be addictive and dangerous in adults.\n\nBut many people who have lived with ADHD, or have kids with it, say that since they were diagnosed and treated, their lives have been transformed. Where once they were unmanageable, they can now lead normal lives.\n\nTreatment\n\nChildren diagnosed with ADHD are given a management plan, with the aim of reducing the effects of ADHD on the child's social, emotional and academic functioning.\n\nThe most common treatment for ADHD is psychostimulant medication such as dexamphetamine (trade name Dexadrine) or methylphenidate (Attenta, Ritalin). These are thought to act by normalising the imbalance in the brain's neurotransmitter chemicals. In general, only psychiatrists and paediatricians are allowed to prescribe them. They are given daily (in two to three doses) in tablet form and may need to be continued for months or years.\n\nRitalin LA (long-acting capsules) have recently been released in Australia. They only need to be taken once a day.\n\nIn many cases (about three-quarters of cases where the child has been correctly diagnosed) they work wonders – the child becomes much calmer and more controlled. Teachers especially notice the difference as the child is much more focussed on their work (although there's no evidence that school performance is actually improved).\n\nLike all medications the stimulants can have side effects. The most common include loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep. Some children initially become irritable, teary and withdrawn – this usually settles. In general, side effects are less common with methylphenidate (Ritalin) than with dexamphetamine. Children taking stimulant medication should be monitored.\n\nThe long-term effect on the development of the child's brain and nervous systems isn't known. And this is cause for concern amongst parents and some paediatricians, who worry that too many children are being treated with stimulants. Australia has about 50,000 children taking stimulants for ADHD, which makes it (per capita) the third highest consumer in the world after the United States and Canada. Consumption is especially high in Western Australia, where there are five times as many as children on stimulants than in Victoria.\n\nSome paediatricians believe this is too high and that there should be more effort made to look at other possible social causes of the child's symptoms. If there are problems in the family or at school, then these need to be addressed, rather than having the child put on stimulants.\n\nSome people turn to alternative therapies, and a diverse range of complementary and alternative therapies are used. None have been subjected to scientific research trials. Some of these therapies can be expensive, and some practitioners offer parents unrealistic hopes of a cure.\n\nNot all children with ADHD require medication and those that do shouldn't be treated with medication alone. Parenting behaviours may need to change. Some suggestions for parents of a child diagnosed with ADHD include:\n\nAccept the situation; be patient. \nSet non-negotiable rules for behaviour and clearly state the consequences of not following the rules. If the rule is broken, warn, then act calmly and without argument. \nSet a routine and stick to it. \nGive praise and rewards for good behaviour. \nBe tolerant; ignore all but the important misbehaviours.8	I got a girls number at the bar last night how long should I wait before I call her.? You always here 3 days.  When do girls really expect a guy whom they gave their number to, to call them. If you got it last night (Thursday), call her late morning Saturday.  3 days is too long.

I would really like to quit smoking and am taking welbutrin to help but still can't seem to stop.  Any ideas to aid me in my quest to stop smoking? Hi...these are just tips, but they're useful:\n1-Count the cigarettes you smoke every day, ...-1 each day/week,slowly!\n2-If you're into coffe-cigarette thing, stop drinking coffee!\n3-If you can't help smoking one, smoke it with the hand you usually don't use, don't sit, stay in a place you don't like. Uncomfortable feelings related to smoking do help!\n4-don't buy cigarettes!At least you can ask someone for one.But if you haven't got the packet, it's more difficult to smoke!\n5-No lighters in your house, no ashtrails.No one is allowed to smoke in your house, not even YOU.\n6-Tell everyone you quitted smoking, so if they see you smoking they're going to have fun on you or think you're weak-willed.\n7-Is there a taste in your mouth that doesn't make you smoke at all (for me, strawberry candies)...use it!\n8-Are you into alcohol/beer-cigarette thing?Avoid it!\n9-I think it's better to quit smoking slowly instead of quickly, but if you want to try...then choose an important date (your birthday party, the arrival of a thing you're waiting, your new car's first day, first day of holidays, stuff like that) and from there, you cannot smoke!\n10-You smoke because you're stressed, or need a moment of rest in the day?Buy a fake cigarette. Smoking, apart from nicotine, is a substitute for meditation!Think about it. When you smoke, you slowly inhale, wait, then exhale your breath, slowly, feeling the air coming inside you and going to the lungs and then going out through the mouth/nose...IT IS meditation!Try doing the same process with a fake cigarette, a pencil or whatever.Breathing deeply helps...\nI hope you'll succeed.

Wilson's Syndrome\n\nIf you have a body temperature of less than 98.6 F. and some of the following symptoms you probably have Wilson's Syndrome. This condition involves a disorder where the cells of the body are unable to convert the inactive thyroid hormone, T4, into the more active hormone, T3. Wilson's Syndrome itself does not alter the thyroid hormone tests. It may exist in association with true hypothyroidism, however. In these cases, thyroid tests may be abnormal but the usually prescribed thyroid hormones may not entirely solve the problem.\n\nIf you suspect that you have Wilson's Syndrome, take your temperature with an accurate glass/mercury thermometer orally 3 hours after getting up and every 3 hours times 3 for a couple of days. If your temperature averages a few 10ths of a degree below 98.6F., and you have several of the above symptoms, you have Wilson's Syndrome.5	How about a super-Olympics, where athletes are allowed whatever drugs they like?  ...Uh, I don't think that It'd be that cool; but for the first time in a long time, there'd be no cheating!5	what 2 teams will make it to the nba finals?

Yes, completely normal! Obviously we're not talking corkscrews here but a little curvature is perfectly normal. And I shouldn't think women would bother about it - I certainly wouldn't - I think personality and humour are more important. Anyway, presumably someone that's seeing it already likes you quite a lot anyway. lol. Seriously, don't worry - my boyfriend's goes slightly to one side (although I won't tell him I wrote that down). There have been some interesting studies done in which researchers morphed faces to be more or less symmetrical. The findings were that we like things more or less symmetrical - but not completely - subjects described feeling uneasy when looking at faces that were completely symmetrical. A little asymmetry apparently puts the mind at rest. Maybe it makes us more trustworthy and more approachable?9	Who was Otto Skorzeny?  Otto Skorzeny, born June 12, 1908, in Vienna, Austria. He was Hitler's favorite commando. At one time considered "the most dangerous man in Europe," by the Allies, Skorzeny was responsible for rescuing Benito Mussolini from a mountaintop resort in Italy, kidnaping the son of Hungarian regent Miklos Horthy, wreaking havoc at the Battle of the Bulge, and preventing Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D Eisenhower from leaving his headquarters in Versailles during Christmas week of 1944 for fear of an alleged assassination plot. At the end of the war, Skorzeny surrendered to the Allies, but was only interned for a few years before managing to escape.0	What is 'Dharma'? Is it not the religious beliefs as understood in Sanskrit? If not, then, what is 'Hinduism'?  Dharma is the sustaining base for the creatures born out of the Nature. When knowledge is not developed living beings endowed with intelligence live by belief or faith. To that extent, Dharma is religious belief by which the society is sustained.  But otherwise its meaning is universal and expanse. It can not be separated from the Truth; but the Truth does not reveal once and for all. Hence, Hinduism is a Dharma which is Revelation of the Truth and by that manifested aspect of Dharma people have been living for last how many millenia has not been recorded in history. Hinduism is a way of experimented living with Truth as its basis. It is hence, is an eclectic culture besides a faith supported by science.\n\nI fully agree with what another learned answerer (rav 142857) has said that Dharma is derived from the root word 'Dhri' that upholds the 'Praja' those born of Prakriti or the Nature. Principles of Hinduism uphold the entire mankind by protecting the Nature who is worshipped as the Primordial Mother that has given birth to every thing in the infinite Universe.0	Why do so many American women think that their sexuality and virginity belongs to a man?

I need this for global history Homework Winston Churchill, Political Leader / Writer / World War II Figure \n\nBorn: 30 November 1874 \nBirthplace: Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England \nDied: 24 January 1965 \nBest Known As: Indefatigable prime minister of Britain during World War II \nSoldier, politician and finally prime minister, Winston Churchill was one of Britain's greatest 20th-century heroes. Churchill fought with the British Army in India and Sudan, and as a journalist was captured in South Africa (where his dispatches from the Boer War first brought him to public prominence). He became a member of Parliament in 1900 and remained an MP for over 64 years. His early topsy-turvy political career earned him many enemies, but his stirring speeches, bulldog tenacity and his refusal to make peace with Adolf Hitler made him the popular choice to lead England through World War II. When Britain and its allies prevailed in 1945, Churchill's place in history was assured. (Ironically, he lost the prime ministership two months after Germany's surrender, when the opposition Labor Party took majority control of Parliament.) One of the 20th century's most quotable wits, Churchill wrote a plethora of histories, biographies and memoirs, including the landmark four-volume A History of the English-speaking Peoples (1956-58). In 1953 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; he was knighted the same year.\n\nChurchill served as prime minister from 1940-45 and again from 1951-55... His wartime contemporaries included presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin... More recent British PMs have included Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair... The famous portrait of a scowling Churchill was taken by Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh.\n\nBritish politician and writer. As prime minister (1940–1945 and 1951–1955) he led Great Britain through World War II. Churchill published several works, including The Second World War (1948–1953), and won the 1953 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nEarly Career\n\nEducated at Harrow and Sandhurst, he became (1894) an officer in the 4th hussars. On leave in 1895, he saw his first military action in Cuba as a reporter for London's Daily Graphic. He served in India and in 1898 fought at Omdurman in Sudan under Kitchener. Having resigned his commission, he was sent (1899) to cover the South African War by the Morning Post, and his accounts of his capture and imprisonment by the Boers and his escape raised him to the forefront of English journalists.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nEarly Government Posts\n\nChurchill was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1900, but he subsequently switched to the Liberal party and was appointed undersecretary for the colonies in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Under Asquith, he was initially (1908–10) president of the Board of Trade, then home secretary (1910–11), and championed innovative labor exchange and old-age pension acts. As first lord of the admiralty (1911), he presided over the naval expansion that preceded World War I.\n\nDiscredited by the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, which he had championed, Churchill lost (1915) his admiralty post and served on the front lines in France. Returning to office under Lloyd George, he served as minister of munitions (1917) and secretary of state for war and for air (1918–21). As colonial secretary (1921–22), he helped negotiate the treaty that set up the Irish Free State.\n\nAfter two defeats at the polls he returned to the House of Commons, as a Constitutionalist, and became (1924–29) chancellor of the exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government. As an advocate of laissez-faire economics, he was strongly criticized by John Maynard Keynes. Churchill was not a financial innovator; he basically followed conventional advice from his colleagues. Nevertheless, Churchill's decision to return the country to the prewar gold standard in6	Can you tell me why people abuse/use bad language so much in chat rooms ? There is hardly any chat room today without people hurling words at each other,funnily, at people whom they dont even know. Sometimes its so difficult to get through to people, make freinds and know about others becos' of this. The abuses are more loud and soo vulgur its hard to continue any conversations. \n\nAnother thing i noticed is, How do people get sexual pleasure by just sitting in front of the comp, talking sex, typing away on the keyboard..Its ok to a certain extent to share pics, stories etc., but i was curious to know what sorta' pleasure (physical sexual pleasure) cud a person get over a computer screen ? I think its sick.. hello arya,\n\nmy answer to part one of your question is this,\nchat rooms by design allow people the format to share their thoughts. sometimes people want to be something they are not. insecure people can force themselves upon others without the fear of retribution, so in effect this gives them the permission they seek to be rude. i have also found that the only way a weak mind can forceably express itself is through profanity. so i will let you draw your own conclusions to that statement.\n\nas far as part two,\narya there are a lot of lonely people in this world and while personally i am not into the whole cyber sex thing, i can understand how it happens. you sound like a reasonable person as your question is stated lucidly, but remember there are a lot of simple minded people in this world that do what they can to get by.\n\nyour question is well stated and i hope my thoughts are helpful to you.\n\ntony9	Ex-president of Iraq Mr Saddam is being tried for genocide in 19 80 eighties.Is not it schoolbook mockery?

I'm trying to lose weight right now, i want to lose 6-10 lbs that's all. So i eat only once a day, and drink a lot of water. After 3 days, i realized that i lost my apetite, i don't want to eat, i'm not hungry, but i have a bad headache. I ate something just 15 minutes ago, and i puked a bit. I puked because i felt something wrong in my stomach, i'm not bulimic. Is it normal ? Is this a sign that i'm bulimic ? Well, its not normal to puke after eating, nor is it normal to loose your appetite. \n\nEating only one meal a day is actually worse for you than eating three meals a day. the best thing you can do is eat five small meals a day...this helps maintain your metabolism, and will get you to burn offf fat more quickly. Eating only once per day starves your body - thats what is causing the headaches. Also, because your body starves, when you do finally eat soemthing - no matter how healthy - the body manufactures it into stored fat. So, youre doing the opposite of what your body wants and needs! \n\nStick with the lots of water, but add in several fruits and veges and exercise. You'll loose those pounds faster than you thought! \n\nGood luck, and remember that no matter who you are or what you think you look like, youre a beautiful person. Always.5	To whom should the Chargers trade Philip Rivers and what should they get in return?  Miami Dolphins.

On one hand, dirty foreigners to sully our clean American ways and suck up taxpayer dollars.  On the other, cheap labor to boost businesses' bottom line and pass savings on to consumers.\n\nHow does a good Republican solve this quandary? Illegal labor isn't cheap. There are too many costs to society. It's just shifting the costs.\n\nAs a conservative, I do not support illegal immigration, and am justly concerned that our government, which has the duty of maintaining the integrity of our borders, is failing so miserably.\n\nIf we need more immigration, LEGAL immigration, then our policies should have reflected that, with increased allowances for immigrants.\n\nBut this out of control situation is indefensible. If we need itinerant workers, then by all means let's set up a program. Then we could control entry, and eliminate the entry of criminals or people with diseases. And we need to eliminate the absurd concept that a child born here is automatically a citizen.\n\nNo, the government has no authority to disobey the laws of the land, and be negligent towards its duties. Time to stop the flood of illegals.1	Matter or absence of matter everything is. Prove me wrong? Electrons are made up from the same stuff as protons. Energy is matter in motion/velocity. Neutrons are a ghost image of the interaction between electrons and protons. Light is made up of photons. Photons are matter at some velocity. All matter is light from a certain point of view. Mathematics combined with the periodic table is the explanation of why chemical reactions happen. Chemical attraction and repultion can be explained via matematics and the periodic table. \nEverything that is, everything that we see, is either here or not. On or off, yes or no, matter or not matter; That is the question! Electrons are made up from the same stuff as protons. \n--Protons are made up of quarks (like Neutrons).  Protons consist of 3 pair quarks, 2 up quarks and a down.\nElectrons are not made up of quarks, so there are not made up of the stuff protons are.\n\nEnergy is matter in motion/velocity.\n--There are many types of energy, not all of it is "matter in motion".  Potential energy is an example.\n\nNeutrons are a ghost image of the interaction between electrons and protons.\n--Well, kinda of yes, kind of no.\nIf you combine a proton and an electron, you will produce a neutron and a neutrino.  This is no easy to acheive but it does happen (in neutron stats).\n\nLight is made up of photons.\n--Yes, but light is BOTH a wave AND a particle.\n\nPhotons are matter at some velocity.\n--No, photons are not matter, thet do not have mass.\n\nAll matter is light from a certain point of view. \n--No.\nMatter can still exist in complete darkness.\n\nMathematics combined with the periodic table is the explanation of why chemical reactions happen.\nChemical attraction and repultion can be explained via matematics and the periodic table. \n--I prefer the Physics way of thinking of it, but if you want to call it math, thats OK too.\n\nEverything that is, everything that we see, is either here or not.

I know many people that call themselves Christians and among one of the followers had an disgrace her apartment got burned and the church were she used to attend denied her any kind of help, another is that some christian radio station is against to ilegal immigrants and they just want them to get out the country, one more is that this famous TV preacher from a well recognized christian tv station asked for Castro death not long time ago, is it true that Mr Bush is Christian if so, why he is so violent and let many innocent people die and why he doesn't realy care about about people...DON'T TAKE ME WRONG!!! am not an killer nor killer lover I just believe that if they call themselves Christians they should serve and help people in need and shouldn't let anyone one down The short answer is, Christians who possess a true understanding of Christ's teachings do not have evil intentions against anyone. Those who do not have a true understanding can fall into a number of categories: mislead, mistaken, ignorant, or as a previous person suggested, just Human (i.e., fallible and imperfect). \n\nThere are, however, those who do have legitimately evil intentions that they seek to carry out in the name of "Christianity". These individuals/groups have no caring for anyone but themselves and their close circle of like-minded "friends". More often than not, your examples (and other things like them) are due to reasons listed in the previous paragraph, but the truly evil intentions do exist. Jesus taught that we will know them "by their fruits"...that is, know them by their actions, NOT their words. If their actions suggest something other than what they claim to be, then they either have an incomplete or incorrect understanding of the true teachings of Christ, or they have other more insidious motives. You will have to decide for yourself who falls into which category.5	Will DX ever come back? If they do, who will be in it?  They will return at Vengence.

The scenery of 'Troy' is pretty accurate . . . the costumes are pretty, and that's about as far as it goes.  The writers took A LOT of liberties with history simply in the fact that the 'bad guy' won.  That is, the Greeks sacked Troy, killed all the men, threw the babies from the walls and sent the women to various city-states as slaves.  Paris and Helen didn't escape in a tunnel.  No happy ending, but Hollywood seems to frequently ignore the facts.  They could have called it anything but 'Troy' and been more accurate.\n\nYes, I own the movie because Eric Bana & Brad Pitt look great in skirts.  Oh, and Sean Bean.

Also by banning sites, China is banning opportunities for demonstrations/uprisings, which could lead to violence.

In the Bible it said Jesus christ fasted... but most of you dont fast as u are supposed... plz answer these questions. Christian Counsel on Fasting. \nWhen Jesus was on earth he gave instruction to his disciples: “When you are fasting, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. But you, when fasting, grease your head and wash your face, that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.” (Mt 6:16-18) He alluded here to the insincere fasting of the Pharisees, which he mentioned in an illustration on another occasion. (Lu 18:9-14) It was customary for the Pharisees to fast twice a week, on the second and fifth days of the week.—Lu 18:12.\n\nA person’s merely abstaining from food in a formalistic manner is described by Paul as subjecting oneself to decrees, “Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,” and he says that “those very things are, indeed, possessed of an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and mock humility, a severe treatment of the body; but they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh.”—Col 2:20-23.\n\nFasting has been enjoined on their members by some religious sects of Christendom, but the Bible itself gives no command to Christians to fast. When Jesus was talking to his disciples about fasting, as above (Mt 6:16-18), he and his disciples were still under the Mosaic Law and observed the Day of Atonement and its fast.\n\nThe text about fasting at Matthew 17:21, appearing in the King James Version, is not contained in some of the most important ancient manuscripts. Likewise, although the King James Version mentions fasting at Mark 9:29, Acts 10:30, and 1 Corinthians 7:5, according to such manuscripts these texts do not contain any references to fasting.\n\nSome have taken Matthew 9:15 as a command for Christians to fast. In reality, Jesus was merely making a statement of what was going to happen when he died. While Jesus was with his disciples on earth, it was not appropriate for them to fast. When he died, they did mourn and fast. But they had no cause for mournful fasting after his resurrection and especially after the marvelous outpouring of holy spirit. (Mr 2:18-20; Lu 5:33-35) Certainly Christians were not under obligation to fast on the anniversary of the Lord’s death, for the apostle Paul, correcting abuses in connection with the eating of supper at the congregation’s meeting place before the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, said: “Certainly you do have houses for eating and drinking, do you not? . . . Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it [the Lord’s Evening Meal], wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.”—1Co 11:22, 33, 34.\n\nWhile not fasting as a religious requirement, the early Christians did fast on special occasions. When Barnabas and Paul were sent on a special missionary assignment into Asia Minor, there was fasting as well as praying. Also, there was the offering of prayer “with fastings” when elders were appointed in a new congregation. (Ac 13:2, 3; 14:23) Hence, Christians are neither under command to fast nor prohibited from doing so.—Ro 14:5, 6.5	What is the best bar in Seattle?

I saw this website: www.HurriCraft.com that shows it as possible?  It's possible. If the air is moving steadily and uniformly you have an easier time with it. This is typically the situation over ocean and away from the eye (ref.). If it's "choppy", with small-scale gusts and wind shear, it gets risky. You can encounter this as you penetrate the eye, where winds reach a maximum and then become very slow. A doppler radar might help you recognize such a situation before you fly into it.1	Vicodin Addiction: What about Vicodin causes addiction? I know alot of people says it offers a calming sinsation and relaxes them and they take it w/o being in chronic pain.... for someone who thinks they might be addicted but have it available to them... who can they wing themselves off of it? Is there any natural or non-narcotic drugs that could offer the same sensation to help a person loose the dependancy of the Vicodin?\n\nAny help (serious help) would be appreciated. Hydrocodone is a morphine molecule with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom attached to it. Essentialy it is morphine that has to be demethylized by the liver before it attaches to opiod receptor at base of brain. The body normaly produces it's own morphine, called endomorphins. When a person is taking morphine (of any form) it precludes the need for the body to produce it's own morphine, or endomorphine, so the internal system that produces endomorphines shuts down over time. When this person stops taking morphine, they experiance all the terrible things that morphine, or endomorphine is supposed to regulate - like body temperature, intestinal motion, pain perception, dysphoria...etc, and the only way to "fix" it is to wait until the endomorphine system starts up again (several months to get back to good condition) or to take more morphine. There are treatments, called medicaly assisted therapies, wherein a patient is prescribed either methadone or suboxone to mediate the withdrawel symptoms. Suboxone is the newest. It is butyl morphine and nalaxone in a pill that one dissolves under the tungue. Butyl morphine is a partial agonist with a high affinity for receptors, so it doesn't switch on the recptors as hard as a regular opiod would, but it sticks to the receptors better than a regular opiod would. The nalaxone is a receptor blocker and only becomes bioavailable if the user crushes and injects the pill - in that case the nalaxone would clean the receptors of any and all opiods and the user would experiance full withdrawel symptoms. The net being that the user who takes suboxone doesn't really get high and if they do try to abuse other opiods they will not get any affect from them. There is also a "ceiling affect" with butyl morphine - so if you try to take a lot of it at once to get high, you don't get any additional affect after a certain amount. The addict would take suboxone for 6 months to a year and then taper off by reducing the dose by a half a milligram a week until down to nothing.8	for the guys**?

Cloning is the process of making a genetically identical organism through nonsexual means. It has been used for many years to produce plants (even growing a plant from a cutting is a type of cloning). People have been cloning plants in one way or another for thousands of years. For example, when you take a leaf cutting from a plant and grow it into a new plant (vegetative propagation), you are cloning the original plant because the new plant has the same genetic makeup as the donor plant. Vegetative propagation works because the end of the cutting forms a mass of non-specialized cells called a callus. With luck, the callus will grow, divide and form various specialized cells (roots, stems), eventually forming a new plant. \n\nMore recently, scientists have been able to clone plants by taking pieces of specialized roots, breaking them up into root cells and growing the root cells in a nutrient-rich culture. In culture, the specialized cells become unspecialized (dedifferentiated) into calluses. The calluses can then be stimulated with the appropriate plant hormones to grow into new plants that are identical to the original plant from which the root pieces were taken. \nMore recently, scientists have been able to clone plants by taking pieces of specialized roots, breaking them up into root cells and growing the root cells in a nutrient-rich culture.

I understand that without rotation we would not be here But just why does the earth rotate anyway? >>>>>Why does the earth and other planets rotate, but not our moon?\n\nThe Moon does rotate, It has day length of just over 28 days. If the moon didn’t rotate then it would show different faces to the Earth as it orbits us, and there would be no ‘dark side’.\n\nThe Moon doesn’t appear to rotate to an observer on Earth because gravitational forces have forced the rotation of the Moon to synchronise with the Earth, the two bodies are tidally locked. As a result the moon rotates at exactly the same rate as it orbits the Earth. It orbits once a month and it rotates once a month. \n>>>>> But just why does the earth rotate anyway? \n\nIt’s called conservation of angular momentum. The Earth condensed out of a massive cloud of dust and rock billions of years ago.  That cloud was all spread out over billions of miles, it covered the entire circular orbit path we take around the Sun as well as stretching half way to Mars and halfway to Venus. It was big cloud. And it was spinning very slowly because of the way it was formed.\n\nThe cloud gradually condensed under the influence of gravity and became a small Earth. But when a spinning object gets smaller it can’t just stop keep spinning at the same speed,  it has to keep spinning faster. You can see this principle applied by ice skaters working up speed. They start spinning with their arms out to make themselves bug, but when they pull their arms in the get smaller and spin faster. The same thing happened with the Earth.  When all that spinning dust got pulled in from billions of miles away the Earth got smaller, and as a result it started spinning a lot faster. So fast in fact that it became noticeable to observers on Earth ( if there had been any) that the Earth spun around totally once a day.\n\nOf course it took another 2 or 3 billion years for life to arise, and another 4 billion years for life to get clever enough to figure out that the Erath did rotate and that the sun wasn’t whizzing around us.6	Has anyone gotten bit by a Brown Recluse spider? if so do you have pics you could send me or at least let me know what part of the body and the duration of time and to what severity it got be.

Why is protesting in the United States against foreign officials a crime, "willfully intimidating, coercing, threatening and harassing a foreign official"?  Seems like if you don't want someone to protest out during a conference, you should have had better security, and if something like this happens you have the right to have your security escort the person away, but simply chanting slogans seems like freedom of speech to me.\n\nFrom an associated press article, avaiable here:\nhttp://msnbc.msn.com/id/12426832\n\n"Woman in protest against Hu charged"\n\nExcerpts: A woman accused of heckling Chinese President Hu Jintao during a White House appearance was charged Friday in federal court with willfully intimidating, coercing, threatening and harassing a foreign official.\n\nDr. Wang Wenyi, 47, had obtained temporary press credentials for Hu's visit Thursday as a reporter for a Falun Gong newspaper... she shouted in Chinese and in English: "President Bush, stop him from killing". President Bush siding up with a Dictator and parading the man around America alone is a travesty. Dr. Wang seems to be the only one at that press conference that had any sense. Why wasn't President Bush asking this man to stop the killings is my question? Bush is so wishy-washy about his Republican agendas, about freedom and Spirituality. The genocide of Communist China makes Saddam and Bin Laden look like Gandhi and Martin Luther King. This constant flip-flopping in front of Americas face is getting real old. I don't think her comment was out of line according to the Evangelist Republican Gestapo tactics on Americans. One killer is good, and other killers are our friends. The Lord Jesus says killing is a sin, and I am going with that theory all the way.

You have to make certain assumptions and guesses, and use them to come up with a possible answer. Here's an example of how to do this problem.\n\nFirst of all, there are 973 years between 1027 and 2000.\n\nWhat's the average net population growth rate for a human population? Let's say it's 1.6% per year over these 973 years - because it's proportional to itself we'll be using an exponential growth equation. Starting with 1 (William himself), we can go 1*(e^(0.016*973)) the population borne out of William the Conquerer will be about 5.7 million. That sounds huge but we're talking about a millennium here, and most of them will have long forgotten about their ancestry (cause of all the daughters.) However, that 5.7 million will be the number of people alive. We're just looking for the population aged 0-1. In 2002 about 10% of the world was aged 0-4 and assuming similar characteristics for 2000 and even distribution inside 0-4 for each year, about 142,500 Conquerer kids were born in 2000.\n\nHow many people were born in the year 2000? Assuming 350,000 births a day over 366 days (leap year), 128.1 million people were born in the year 2000.\n\n142500/128100000 = 0.11%\n\nThat means the odds are about 1 in 900. Better than you'd think? Again, this could be widely varied depending on the assumptions you make. But I think that might be in the ballpark.1	what is bermuda triangle ??  this bermuda triangle is located in southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States which is known to have a large gravitational pull such that even ships dont return back from there..1	how do convert centigrade temeratures to ferenheigh?

In computer security technology, a virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. A computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of a virus into the program is termed as an infection, and the infected file (or executable code that is not part of a file) is called a host. \n\nIn the context of computer software, a Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software. The term is derived from the classical myth of the Trojan horse. In the siege of Troy, the Greeks left a large wooden horse outside the city. The Trojans were convinced that it was a gift, and moved the horse to a place within the city walls. It turned out that the horse was hollow, containing Greek soldiers who opened the city gates of Troy at night, making it possible for the Greek army to pillage the city. Trojan horse programs work in a similar way: they may look useful or interesting (or at the very least harmless) to an unsuspecting user, but are actually harmful when executed.\n\nA computer worm is a self-replicating computer program, similar to a computer virus. A virus attaches itself to, and becomes part of, another executable program; however, a worm is self-contained and does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_virus0	Famous person that has contributed to Canada? hey.  my teacher gave us a book report that we must do on someone famous that has contributed to canada in some way.  im just wondering if u could think of someone famous that has contributed to canada in any away.  i dont mean famous like movie star famous.  if u have answer, that would be great, and please include a book about that person if u know one.  it should be on a grade 8 level.\nthanks a million how about Lester B Pearson: 14 th prime minister of Canada, Nobel peace prize winner, introduced the concept of peacekeeping to the UN, universal health care, student loans, bilingualism, Canada pension plan and Canada's flag3	Math Problem!!!

Can someone with a GPA of 3.8 and? ACT score of 22 get any form of scholarsip It depends on what school you are applying to first of all.  Apply as early as you can.  When I was accepted I applied as early as I could and was notified of my acceptance within a month or two if I remember correctly (this was 5 years ago!).  I had a GPA of 3.2 and an ACT of 23 and I was accepted into the school of science.  That being said I went to a very prestigious boarding school and participated in a lot of extra curricular activities.\nAs for scholarships, contact someone at the school and ask them for help.  One of the things I loved most about Purdue is although it is a very large school, I knew all my counselors and professors and spoke with them often.  So you don't get lost in the crowd there!

How to invent formulas & if we have something how we could know that what elements does it contain A "regular joe" can almost never know unless it is printed on the label.  You could also Google the name of the substance, and maybe you'll get lucky.\n\nAs for scientists, we use GCMS which stands for Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectroscopy.  We can also use NMR or Nuclear Magnetic Resonanace.  \n\nSuper heat the substance to a vapor and then pass light through a sample.  The amount of light absorbed is often an indicator of amounts and types of elements.\n\nBombard a substance with electrons and watch for light emitted.  When eletrons hit a particular molecule, they give off vey specific energy in the form of light or heat.

Who cares about the South Korean border we have our own to protect. I do believe you need a balance.. but if we would be smarter about what we do with our military we wouldn't need as large of a standing military... then we could put money back into the nation to fix our schools and help better the social issues we face, as well as advance sciences.. including those that would help protect this nation without the loss of human life (or at least limit it)... but that would be the best thing to do for our nation as opposed to our politicians.. so don't expect it to happen :(\n\n\ncynthiatweedle- Not trying to knock your intentions.. but the no child left behind program is a fraud.. it sounds great but it's not.. the "numbers" they used to try and make it look good only focused on the top 50% of the children in the schools it was piloted in and there was some improvement in those children... but in the schools as a whole there was marked worsening.. the drop out rate and test scores were much worse than they were before it was piloted in Texas.   Coordinated School Health is a much better program if you are looking for something for your schools... in the schools that have used it the drop out rates have fallen from in the 20%'s to less than 1% and the teen pregnancy rates and arrest rates have shown the same decline.  It is very similar to the School of the 21st Century program which has also shown some great results.2	Can you lose weight by excercising?? We had an argument between me and my mother...

There was a lull in progressive music in the '80's after the "art-rock" explosion of the '70's. Then, during the latter part of the decade, "Prog" started to make a come-back. \nNow, it seems as though it's hit another lull in the amount of true prog-rock bands that are out there. However, there are several excellent "Prog-Art-Rock" bands around.(The Mars Volta, Univers Zero, Cryptic Vision, Kino, The Flower Kings, etc.) The real trick is finding any of their material - especially, in the U.S. (Try these websites: www.prog4you.com - or - progarchives.com)\nProg music will always be around - it just will never gain any sort of mainstream acceptance. Which is good, because look what happened to "Metal" in the '80's when it became popular. I'm glad something finally came along to slay that monster. But why did it have to be "Grunge"?7	back to the future confusion? in the 2nd movie of the bttf trilogy, marty and doc try to stop martys son from committing a crime, but how can they change it from happening, if its in the future not the present Doc went further into the future to see Marty's son commit a crime, then went back a few days (with Marty) before the crime happened.

Develop your voice – A high whiney voice is not perceived to be one of authority.  In fact, a high soft voice can make you sound like prey to an aggressive co-worker who is out to make his/her career at the expense of anyone else.   Begin doing exercises to lower the pitch of your voice.  Here is one to start:  Sing — but do it an octave lower on all your favorite songs.  Practice this and, after a period of time, your voice will begin to lower. \n\n2. Slow down – People will perceive you as nervous and unsure of yourself if you talk fast.  However, be careful not to slow down to the point where people begin to finish your sentences just to help you finish. \n\n3. Animate your voice – Avoid a monotone.  Use dynamics.  Your pitch should raise and lower.  Your volume should be soft and loud.  Listen to your local TV news anchor; take notes. \n\n4. Enunciate your words – Speak clearly.  Don’t mumble.  If people are always saying, “huh,” to you, you are mumbling. \n\n5. Use appropriate volume – Use a volume that is appropriate for the setting.  Speak more softly when you are alone and close.  Speak louder when you are speaking to larger groups or across larger spaces. \n\n6. Pronounce your words correctly – People will judge your competency through your vocabulary.  If you aren’t sure how to say a word, don’t use it. \n\n7. Use the right words – If you’re not sure of the meaning of a word, don’t use it.  Start a program of learning a new word a day.  Use it sometime in your conversations during the day. \n\n8. Make eye contact – I know a person who is very competent in her job.  However, when she speaks to individuals or groups, she does so with her eyes shut.  When she opens them periodically, she stares off in a direction away from the listener.  She is perceived as incompetent by those with whom she consults.  One technique to help with this is to consciously look into one of the listener’s eyes and then move to the other.  Going back and forth between the two (and I hope they only have two) makes your eyes appear to sparkle.  Another trick is to imagine a letter “T” on the listener’s face with the cross bar being an imaginary line across the eye brows and the vertical line coming down the center of the nose.  Keep your eyes scanning that “T” zone. \n\n9. Use gestures – Make your whole body talk.  Use smaller gestures for individuals and small groups.  The gestures should get larger as the group that one is addressing increases in size. \n\n10. Don’t send mixed messages – Make your words, gestures, facial expressions, tone, and message match.  Disciplining an employee while smiling sends a mixed message and, therefore, is ineffective.  If you have to deliver a negative message, make your words, facial expressions, and tone match the message.2	do height increasing devices shown on television works?  Nope!1	How do virus mutate?  Mutations is viral strains are highly exhibited when they are retroviruses such as HIV or the H5N1 strain. Such viruses do not have DNA initially, much simpler for them. An enzyme called Reverse Transcriptase transcribes DNA from RNA when these viruses invade host cells. However, these is a 'stupid' enzyme and it makes mistakes, and for every mistakes it makes, another strain is created due to mutation. For the influenza virus, this is such a trivial phenomenon. It happens almost all the time. But since viruses are relatively much less complicated than eukaryotes, an error usually does not prove fatal. For mammals, there is a smart enzyme called DNA polymerase which transcribes RNA from DNA and the error checking mechanisms are so intricate. \nThe other way can be the kind sort of mentioned by one of the other answerer's. This gene transfer is the so called Horizontal Gene Transfer and it can result in a modified viral strain but I think that is the case mainly for DNA viruses.0	is kimberly caldwell from american idol a lesbian??

This is more or less the number of baserunners a pitcher allows an inning... this is also considered a more accurate representation of how good a pitcher is (much more so than ERA).\n\nA excellent WHIP is 1.00 or under; usually only the top closers and maybe one or two starters have WHIPs this low.  A WHIP of 1.50 I'd think would be average, anything above that is... not very good.1	Why do some animals give birth to 1 baby and others give birth to more than 1?  It all depends on the needs of the animal or species, as well as energy usage.  Prey items such as mice or rabbits put a lot of energy into producing several babies frequently, with less time spent raising them (a month as opposed to a year or more).  This is because they need to keep the population booming, as there is a high mortality rate due to predation.  On the other hand, predators, such as big cats, or larger animals that don't have predators, such as elephants, put less energy into biologically developing a lot of babies, and put more time and energy into raising the few that they have, to ensure that the young are ready/fit to survive.  It's a quantity versus quality issue.  Animals have a limited amount of energy they can devote to reproduction, so they have to make a "choice."  It can't be both.0	how many cuntry in the world and how many christian country and muslim etc, religion vise country list?

I heard yoga was a great option for pregnant women Found this site that shows some good poses during pregnancy (scroll down below the Childbirth at Home section).

The breath starts in your belly, then it travels up through your chest and throat.  Breathing out, it leaves the same way.  Slowly, with control, and relaxed.9	I was in a car wreck a few months ago--how much compensation do I deserve.? I was in a car wreck a few months ago, and was wondering how much compensation I deserve. I was blind sided by I guy driving a van in the wrong lane. He was going 45-50 when he struck me and was obviously cited. He did not have any insurance therefore mine paid to fix my car. I had two doctor visits and a severely sprained neck. I had a laceration on my head also. I still have back and neck pain as I am sure you would imagine I would receive from a blow like that. My insurance company is going to give me a compensation check, they offered me 600.00 which I feel is an ABSOLUTE insult. What kind of numbers should I request? (500.00 dollars towing + 400.000 deductible + inconvenience etc…) You should contact a lawyer.  $600 is totally unreasonable.  I would say that $2500 is the absolute minimum that you should consider.  You have bills for towing, buying a new car, lost work, and medical expenses.  Contacting a lawyer will show that you mean business and maybe will get you a better deal.  If not, I would definitely consider legal action to recover at least your expenses (not including any pain and suffering) incurred as a result of this accident.6	if i want to sell some shares that ive brough from the stockmarket how can i be sure they will sell ? for example; if i got them on monday and by friday they had increased, how do i know that i can offload them ? is there always a guarantee that someone will buy them ? If the share is quoted on the main London Stock Exchange market one broker will have been assigned to act as the Market Maker.  That means that they are given preferential trading rights and in return they agree to act as a buyer when someone else wants to sell and the seller when someone else wants to buy.\n\nYou can't guarantee the price you will receive but there will always be someone there to buy them.  As the last resort the Market Maker has to buy them off you.2	Wisdom teeth? Hey.... how do you know when they appear? Do they come along with pain on the gum? \n\nThanks.

I moved onto cigars then eventually stopped. Exercise is very good for taking your mind off smoking. Avoid going into bars where there are smokers.

Failing that, try handcuffs!6	please answer !!!!!!   do u have bussniuess mind ???? i have a pharmacy with poor people around , like for instance cosmatics dont get much attention there , only chronic people take thier medicine ,,, what should i do to increase my income , knowing that many people enter the pharmacy without much earning money First, take inventory of what you have and figure out what people ARE buying from you now. Then increase your offerings in those areas and get rid of things that don't sell.  If people don't have a lot of money they will still need to buy essential items like food, toilet paper, paper towels, deodorants, toothpaste.... Try and give them options that will allow them the "convenience" of picking up their medicines AND other items they will need. I hope this helps!2	Peeing CANT STOP CANT GO!!!! HELP!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!?

The History of Yahoo! - How It All Started...\nYahoo! began as a student hobby and evolved into a global brand that has changed the way people communicate with each other, find and access information and purchase things. The two founders of Yahoo!, David Filo and Jerry Yang, Ph.D. candidates in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, started their guide in a campus trailer in February 1994 as a way to keep track of their personal interests on the Internet. Before long they were spending more time on their home-brewed lists of favorite links than on their doctoral dissertations. Eventually, Jerry and David's lists became too long and unwieldy, and they broke them out into categories. When the categories became too full, they developed subcategories ... and the core concept behind Yahoo! was born. \n\nThe Web site started out as "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" but eventually received a new moniker with the help of a dictionary. The name Yahoo! is an acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle," but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they liked the general definition of a yahoo: "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth." Yahoo! itself first resided on Yang's student workstation, "Akebono," while the software was lodged on Filo's computer, "Konishiki" - both named after legendary sumo wrestlers. \n\nJerry and David soon found they were not alone in wanting a single place to find useful Web sites. Before long, hundreds of people were accessing their guide from well beyond the Stanford trailer. Word spread from friends to what quickly became a significant, loyal audience throughout the closely-knit Internet community. Yahoo! celebrated its first million-hit day in the fall of 1994, translating to almost 100 thousand unique visitors. \n\nDue to the torrent of traffic and enthusiastic reception Yahoo! was receiving, the founders knew they had a potential business on their hands. In March 1995, the pair incorporated the business and met with dozens of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They eventually came across Sequoia Capital, the well-regarded firm whose most successful investments included Apple Computer, Atari, Oracle and Cisco Systems. They agreed to fund Yahoo! in April 1995 with an initial investment of nearly $2 million. \n\nRealizing their new company had the potential to grow quickly, Jerry and David began to shop for a management team. They hired Tim Koogle, a veteran of Motorola and an alumnus of the Stanford engineering department, as chief executive officer and Jeffrey Mallett, founder of Novell's WordPerfect consumer division, as chief operating officer. They secured a second round of funding in Fall 1995 from investors Reuters Ltd. and Softbank. Yahoo! launched a highly-successful IPO in April 1996 with a total of 49 employees. \n\nToday, Yahoo! Inc. is a leading global Internet communications, commerce and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services to more than 345 million individuals each month worldwide. As the first online navigational guide to the Web, www.yahoo.com is the leading guide in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user reach. Yahoo! is the No. 1 Internet brand globally and reaches the largest audience worldwide. The company also provides online business and enterprise services designed to enhance the productivity and Web presence of Yahoo!'s clients. These services include Corporate Yahoo!, a popular customized enterprise portal solution; audio and video streaming; store hosting and management; and Web site tools and services. The company's global Web network includes 25 World properties. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., Yahoo! has offices in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, Canada and the United States.5	I am looking for FC.INTER song (hymn), what is the title and can I find it on internet?  fc internazionale milano has three hymn:\n1-inno anni inter\n2-pazza inter amala\n3-c' solo inter\nu can find all of them in: www.tutointer.com  (in audio part of this site)\nforza INTER and all nerazzurri fans!\npazza inter lyric:\n\nLo sai per un gol\nio darei la vita….la mia vita\nChe in fondo lo so\nsarà una partita….infinita\n\nE’ un sogno che ho\nè un coro che sale….a sognare\nSu e giù dalla Nord\nnovanta minuti …per segnare\n\nNerazzurri\n\nnoi saremo qui\nNerazzurri\n\npazzi come te\nNerazzurri\n\nNon fateci soffrire\nma va bene… vinceremo insieme!\n\nAmala!\n\nPazza Inter amala!\n\nE’ una gioia infinita\nche dura una vita\nPazza Inter amala!\n\nVivila!\n\nquesta storia vivila\n\nPuò durare una vita\no una sola partita\nPazza Inter amala!\n\nE continuerò\nnel sole e nel vento… la mia festa\nPer sempre vivrò\n\ncon questi colori…. nella testa\n\nNerazzurri\n\nio vi seguirò\nNerazzurri\n\nsempre lì vivrò\nNerazzurri\nquesta mia speranza\nE l’assenza\nio non vivo senza!!!\n\nAmala!\n\nPazza Inter amala!\n\nE’ una gioia infinita\nche dura una vita\nPazza Inter amala!\n\nSeguila!\n\nin trasferta o giu’ in città\n\nPuò durare una vita\no una sola partita\nPazza Inter amala!!!\nLà in mezzo al campo c’è un nuovo campione\nÈ un tiro che parte da questa canzone\n\nForza non mollare mai!!!\nAMALA!!!\n\nAmala\n\nPazza Inter amala!\nÈ una gioia infinita\nche dura una vita\nPazza Inter Amala!!!\nPazza Inter Amala!!\nAMALA!!!!9	claim of prescriptive easement on 2 feet strip of property of neighbor where a fence has been for over 50,year neighbor wants us to move fence. what options do we have to keep it where it is and has been for over 50 years It sounds like you have acquired adverse posession of the land, but the exact requirements of that vary by state. If you believe you have adverse posession, file a "quiet title" action in court to quiet all other claims to the land.

It walked over to the bed and lifted my foot up by the big toe about 15 inches off the bed.\n\nI screamed and it disappeared into itself.\n\nMy mother heard my scream and I told her never mind, I thought I saw a ghost.\n\nIn the morning I heard her laughing about it with my dad so I told her about how it lifted my big toe up into the air. She paused and then told me that that was how her mother used to wake her up of a morning. \n\nMy nana has been deceased since I was 7 years old.\n\nI havnt seen her since but i would like to.

My 11 yr old is and all star soccer player who has been playing for the past 7 years with our recreation dept. He was use to playing the whole game because he is good but this year he started middle school and went out for the team there and he made it. He is good but as we all know you can be the best at something and still have room for learning and improving. He is 11 so he of course has room for it. He is getting upset though because the coach will only play him for 20 mins or so a game. He is feeling that he is not good enough. which he is but the 8th graders are holding senoirity and playing the whole games. there are some 6th graders on the team not playing at all but yet the practice just as hard as the rest of the team. He is feeling down on himself and wanting to quit what should we do Logically in his mind, he feels he's a better player.  Therefore he should get more play time.  Nothing wrong with that logic.  Seniority is a fact of life though as unfair as it is.  I don't like to practice it in the work enironment but there are rare instances when decisions have to be made and length of service becomes a deciding factor.  Teaching him to roll and bow down may not necessarily be the best thing to teach him.  Has he pointed out his feelings to his coach?  The coach might take it into consideration.  The coach might even admire his confidence and try not to discourage it.  Throwing tantrums however won't get him far; a mature approach is best.  Making the coach aware might make the coach give him the encouragement he needs.9	Can you help me? I came to US from Europe 5 years ago on a work visa. I've been paying taxes from the moment I started working and it really hurts me to see all the hate from you, Americans. \nYou think all illegals have come from South America and that's far cry from the facts:25% of all illegals are fluent English speaking immigrants from Europe.

It will be agonising experience, of course, momentarily. At the same time, the tasty food in your mouth will be goading you to munch further!

That is very sweet of you to look out for your friends.\n\nThere is a good chance that nothing will ever happen between any of them.\n\nIf by chance, any of the two friends does start to get more serious with this person, then it would be best to warn your friend - but the stars may be in this person's eyes, and he or she may think that you are jealous.  That is why you are warning her or him.\n\nKeep a close watch on them - as you are - but don't make a move until they get into the line of fire.\n\nYour friends will also have to learn who is truly sincere and who is a phony - so you can't always protect them - they need to learn this on their own - even if it hurts - because otherwise, they will make the same mistake over and over again.\n\nGood Luck And God bless you all.1	In what way does c (the constant for the speed of light) affect the mass to have as....? a result the energy supported by it???

( don't judge me on this) I just want to know as I have missed a pill before in the middle of the month and wonder if this would coincide with when egg release would usually happen.\n\nno critical answers please. it regulates menstruation but stop ovulation unless you are sick and have the runs then the oral contraceptive is useless1	what exactaly does greenhouse effect have to do with global warming?  Greenhouse effect refers to the manner in which the buildup of certain gases trap a certain percent of the suns rays from reflecting back into space.  This percentage of the suns rays are re-reflected back into the earth's atmosphere, which causes an average overall warming of the earth's climate.  The effect is similar to the way that sunlight is reflected back upon itself within a greenhouse, causing the air inside a greenhouse to be warmer than the air outside.6	Chinese writing relies on pictographic characters instead of a phonetic alphabet, so how do they file stuff?

I just started my new job and I cant go to the doctor until April 1 You can apply a thing called a hot potise ( I dont think ive spelled it right !! ) .. Get a slice of bread cover it in boiling water then add some salt .. Leave it for a couple of seconds for the salt to soak in & then apply it as hot as you can for as long as you can to the boil..

I'm trying to prepare for a debate and we are arguing AGAINST the fact that the IRS violates fourth amendment rights.  Any perspectives would be helpful! No, the 16th Amendment says, "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." If the 4th amendment would have applied before that amendment was passed (which I doubt), passing the 16th completely empowered Congress to tax incomes, regardless of all previous amendments.\n\nAlso, about the "missing" 13th ammendment, it regards titles of nobility, not lawyers.8	what does it mean if your husband buys a woman something and doesn't tell you? We have been married for 4 years, He says that we do not have to tell each other everything, which is true, but should he buy a woman a book and not tell me? Maybe I am just being silly. Go with your gut on this one.  \nI say it's very inappropriate.  Even if this relationship is purely friendship it is definitely crosses some boundrys.  Also, if his actions are making you feel bad or insecure he should put an end to whatever it is that makes you feel that way.  YOU should be his number one priority - not his so called "freedom" to go off buying other woman gifts!\nP.S.  You are NOT being silly your emotions are yours and are there for a reason, don't deny that, don't deny yourself!2	my girlfriend kepts getting a realy bad yeast infection, she tried everything please help?  She should go to her gynecologist right away. Some yeast infections need extra strength medication only a doctor can prescribe and she should have tests done because it may not be just a yeast infection. Is she taking antibiotics? This can bring on  a yeast infection. Also, a home remedy that my friend swears by is a plain yogurt douche. My friend says that rubbing it on the irritated skin, soothes it too. She should wear loose clothing and cotton panties. Yeast infections can occur due to stress. Make sure she is not too stressed.3	The Tradedy of Julius Caesar: Act IV?

Anyone of any gender who does not bathe for two or more days will have an offensive body odor on the genitals because of the microorganisms, like e-coli and yeasts that are found in the discharge from body orfices and the absence of oxygen and light from those body parts.8	how does a guy REALLY know if she is "faking"? um...its not for me...its for a friend of mine.... Usually you can tell if the woman is really turned on or not by noticing her body reactions.  When a woman is about to orgasm she may get a red flush on her chest just below her neck.  Her breasts increase in size.   The muscles of her body tense up and when the orgasm come they are suddenly released.   You should also be able to feel the contractions of her vagina if her vaginal muscles are strong enough.   Of course she can fake that by squeezing them, but she has to really be trying to fake if she can remember to squeeze her vaginal muscles too.7	What is the best TV show on right now?  csi   law and order6	what makes a good receptionist in an office type situation? This is a new position created within an acedemic set up and I wanted to know how it should run Don't let the smile fool you.  The receptionist is the first impression a customer gets of a company.  And in return, the customer represents himself first to the receptionist.  \n\nAlert and a quick thinker, a receptionist must be a pro at multi-tasking.  The skilled receptionist will make it look easy, with the flutter of a busy day going on around her/him.  \nDispersing the workload evenly throughout a company might include the receptionist.  Mail delivery, pkg prep, data entry, typing, supply orders.  Using a receptionist for all phone traffic isn't necessarily the most efficient.  A "menu" giving the caller options will work in some companies, just depends.  But having a receptionist route the wife's call, a golfing buddy, the client who just left, etc..  is a waste of a good receptionist.  \n\nAnd please pay this position well.  And I mean well.  Don't even consider anything below $15 a hour, unless you don't value first impressions, can't manage the workload and don't care who is out there greeting the world.  Remember the recep knows where all the skeletons are buried.... Want to keep good employees?  Pay them better....7	does any one know the lyrics to Peace by Promise of Barbados?  no i don't even know the song, but if you want to find out, go to leoslyrics.com, it's a really great lyrics site3	teaching social studies abroad?

My wife used to like foreplay stuff like me going down town and me using my hands and you know all the normal stuff that people do before the do.  Why would she stop liking all that?  We only have sex, and it seems rather mechanical and not very passionate (nothing like it was when we used to make out back in the days.)  I ask her why and she recognizes it but doesn't understand why either.  Could it be psychological or phisiological from maybe new birth control? I can't seem to get her heated up anymore and it was no problem in the past.  We almost have to always use ky and she's hardly ever in the mood. Anybody ever deal with this?  We are both very young in 20s.  What's going on? She just wants to get to it and get it over with.  Foreplay just prolongs it.3	How or where can i see or read my anwer?

I ALWAYS BE HAVING CRAMPS AND I SLEEP A LOT There is always a chance of becoming pregnant when having sexual intercourse. However, then chance isnt as high as people belive. If a woman has unprotected sex, at the time she is ovualting, she only has about a 25-33% chance of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe 'period' that you could have been experiencing could be implantation bleeding. This is when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. This can cause spotting anywhere from 6-15 days after conception, and teh spotting can last anywhere from 1 day to 1 week.\n\nIf anything, at least take a pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests can determine a positive pregnancy 12-15 days from conception. A blood pregnancy test can determine a pregnancy 6-8 days from conception.9	When is voting day in Australia?

MY MOTHER WAS IN NORTH FLA REGIONAL HOSPITAL, GAINESVILLE, FLA, SHE HAD A SEVERE GOUT FLARE-UP, WHILE SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM A HIP REPLACEMENT,  AND WAS GIVEN ACTH GEL AS AN INJECTION IN HER STOMACH, SHE HAS NOT HAD A FLARE-UP IN A YEAR; MY HUSBAND HAS HAD A SEVERE GOUT FLARE-UP FOR 2 WEEKS, HE HAS GONE TO THE ER TWICE HIS WEEK AND IS UNABLE TO WALK, I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM WRITHE IN PAIN LIKE THIS, BEFORE...PLEASE HELP! I am not familiar with the gel that you speak of, however, gout is characterized by accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints caused by excess uric acid in the blood.  Uric acid is a byproduct of the breakdown of protein that is normally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.  To reduce uric acid concentrations it is necessary to support the kidneys, adrenal and immune system functions.  It is also necessary to detoxify by cleansing and drinking plenty of fluids.\n\nExcess alcohol, allergy-producing foods (get checked for food sensitivities by a naturopath), or strict diets can cause outbreaks of gout.  Foods rich in purines, such as wine, anchovies and animal liver can also cause gout.\n\nEssential oils can greatly help in the battle by supporting normal body functions.  You can try geranium, ledum, carrot seed, celery, juniper, rosemary CT cineol, Roman chamomile, lemon, Melaleuca alternifolia (also known as tea tree), nutmeg and Idaho tansy or there are some blends available that may relieve some of the symptoms called PanAway and JuvaFlex.  You can apply these to the affected area and some of them can be ingested as supplements.\n\nPlease assure that if you try essential oils they are therapeutic-grade.  Not all essential oils on the market are equal, some are even toxic.  If you would like further information, please contact me.8	how do you love your man?  Doing things for him.

It is now obvious that Bush and his cronies were wrong and probably lied about the threat of WMD in Iraq. Of course no one from his administration mentions WMD anymore, and now he's got Rice talking about Iran and what a threat they are...another attempt to deflect attention from his sagging ratings and all the scandals and mishandling of so many important issues, mostly domestic here in the USA. This war is nothing but a well masked Imperial invasion of another country we did not want to threaten the fruit of Zionist Terrorism, The Aparthied State of Israel, and a country we wanted to rid of its resources.\n\nKaput.

Are you legally allowed to? Yes.\n\nDo you have the required knowledge to do it successfully? I can't answer that based on the information you've given.\n\nThe California Probate Code (start with sections 6110 and read on) cover the requirements for formal and holographic wills.\n\nThe tricky bits come when wills intersect with community property laws, and when you have complicated property ownership issues that need to be resolved. If it's simply "X and Y get everything in equal shares" and you're not married, then you might be fine. Otherwise, it's probably worth getting some legal help. Many schools offer legal clinics that are run by law students and supervised by attorneys.\n\nOf course, if you have a lot of property assets, it's worth spending a little money now on a lawyer, to make sure the will is drafted correctly. A little money now could save a lot of money for your heirs if your estate is at all complicated.1	how do birds hove sex?

It could be better or it could be worse.2	fitness classes which are the best? which would be the best exercise  to lose weight fast and tone up in five months,yoga or aerobics (sorry about the spelling)i need to lose 2 and a half stone please help.

An abstract class is a special type of class that cannot be instantiated.  To use it, you must create another class that inherits from your abstract class.\n\nAn interface only contains method signatures, not implementations.  It is basically a contract.  Any class that implements an interface must implement the methods contained in that interface.\n\nAs a side note, a C# class can implement multiple interfaces but it can only inherit one abstract class.8	Why do so many request to chat with Minors on this site?

Most often it would say something to the effect of "If you approve my loan, I will start construction."\n\nSo using your words, "If you sanction my loan, I will start construction."  'Will' is not needed in the first half and 'the' is not needed, in fact should not be there.  "the construction" would be the noun version, where you are more than likely saying construction as a verb...If you act, I will act.  However, if it's a cause and effect sentence, you want it like this...\n\nAfter(or When) you sanction my loan, then I will start construction.8	does he even deserve me?

I was just diagnosed with a seizure disorder and put on medication that my doctor told me is safe during pregnancy because I want to conceive in the next few months.  I looked it up on safefetus.com and it was only given a grade of "C," and says it should only be taken during pregnancy if absolutely necessary.  I'm not sure that the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.  I'd rather have seizures than have something happen to my baby.  So far my seizures have only been in my sleep.  What do you think I should do? Preventing seizures while you are pregnant is "absolutely necessary.". They have to pick the lesser of two evils when it comes to medications during pregnancy... and in this case they will probably tell you to continue the medication. Pregancy category C meds are given alot more than you would think.1	Are Fe2(SO4)3, Na2(BO3),  SiC2ionic polar or nonpolar??  Iron sulfate and sodium borate are ionic. SiC2 is covalent.  (This is due to the proximity, or lack thereof, of each main element in the periodic table.)  The concept of polar/nonpolar is used only with covalent molecules to describe whether or not they have a sufficient dipole moment to interact with other polar/nonpolar molecules.  I don't know the arrangement of atoms in SiC2 but, if the molecule is linear, the moment of the two Si-C bonds cancel out and it is nonpolar.  If SiC2 is bent, it's polar.6	Is Variable Life Insurance a good investment vechicle? I've heard good and bad about VUL. Given that a person has a stable job with benefits, would a mix of mutual funds and VUL be good investment choices? VUL is not worth it.  Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool.  Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection.  VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.\n\nThe admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments).  With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.\n\nYou have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments.  Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.\n\nIsn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk?  VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation.  If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL.  If you can afford it, go with Whole life.  It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it.2	i need some help with my throat? okay so um monday night i choked on some candy and i havent been able to swallow anything..i went to the hospital tuesday and they told me they couldnt find anything in there and i should just to keep throwing up for a day and that if it doesnt work then they will send me back and will have to go down my throat and work on it...okay what i wanna know is what does it mean when they go down your throat..like what do they do..im suppose to get whatever that is done in about a hour and im so scared cause i dont know what they going to do..if u know what it means tell me please They will most likely scope you with something that has a camera on it to locate the candy in your throat.

Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state.4	When updating with Windows update.It wont update & keeps saying it will only upgrade an existing Microsoft vm?  sounds like you have a pirate copy.\ngo back to microsoft site, and see if you can validate.\ngood luck.9	Looking for an employment attorney, no upfront fees & not afraid of a little work.

The house rear property is approximately 6-8 feet elevated above the wooded creek. Deer, birds and small animals drink from it often. We have a bench overlooking the creek. Note: the creek(4-5 feet wide) works as a buffer zone from the neighbor behind us.  I'd appreciate any feedback fellow Yahoo'ers. I have read that it is auspicious to have water ponds and slow-moving streams in the front of the home to collect beneficial chi.\n\nI know this may not be feasible for you, but I have read this from more than one source on feng shui.  \n\nThis is even more apparent to me because we have a pond in the backyard with a small circulating waterfall.  To me, it is a bit too close to the house and causes a bit of insecure feelings to build up.  Other than that, is is sometimes a very beautiful pond to see.  \n\nGood luck fellow feng shui enthusiest!7	is it  true that the lead singer of guns and roses died? if so what from? i think his name was axle rose.

Because that is what life is about! Keeping us on our toes....keeping us alert......presenting challenge after challenge so that we never become stagnated and always strive to improve......to grow. If life were predictable, wouldn't we all be so bored. If we knew what was around each corner would we not turn around and go back? Sure.....we get to piss and moan about "Why didn't someone tell me this could happen???"

How is that decision made?? *Original bad back/ back injury resulted from a car accident in 2000 \n\n*Seeked & recieved medical attention (chicopractor) for 2-3+ years\n\n*Pain continued & has persisted 6+ years, but has gotten better\n\n*Recent car crash has completely deminished any progress & pain is almost unbareable\n\n*No moved or slipped disks, etc..\n\n*Extreme pain in entire back- from top to bottom\n\n*Muscles & nerves very tense & tight Tough question.  Its a personal decision.\n\nFirst off, if there is no slipped disk or nerves being pinched or associated weakness and numbness  in extremities, what exactly is the back surgeon going to fix??  I mean I doubt back surgery of any type is going to take away the pain from "top to bottom."\n\nI think the following are the factors that you need to think about:\n\n1)Neurological symptoms like leg numbness or weakness, compromised walking.  These symptoms can progress over time and you may not get function back if you wait to long.  Usually there is an identifiable lesion like a slipped disk pushing on a nerve on MRI.\n\n2)Chronic back pain that is amenable to surgery.  For instance anterolithesis or posterolithesis where the vertebral body is slipped forward or backwards.  In conditions like these the pain may became unbearable (this is where personal choice is important) and you can't stand it any longer that surgery is the only option.\n\n3)What does the back surgeon say?  Its important to seek the consult of multiple back surgeons that are reputable. Sometimes, more often then not, back surgery results in more pain and disability.  Some people often have 1 surgery after the next to fix the problems from the previous surgeon.  If 3 surgeon says its not fixable and 1 says they can help I would trust the first 3 surgeons.\n\n4)You have exhausted all your option.  Chiropractors, medications, physical therapy, alternative medicine, massage therapy, accupucture, yoga.\n\nMy sense, again is if you have pain from "top to bottom" surgery isn't going to help.  If there is no identifiable cause of this pain, surgery will not improve your situation.  A chronic pain specialist have actually be more helpful.9	con/the hostage negotiators conference in monterey, CA in May 2006?  what exactly is your question?0	Will JESUSCHRIST forgive us all the time? Will he tell us someday: ''HEY, NOT MORE FOR U'' ''YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE'' ''IM NOT TO FORGIVE U ANYMORE''??? Jesus himself was asked by a disciple how many times should i forgive.....and he said seventy times seven...i believe if you are really going to count that many, then you have no love or forgiveness in yourself....i dont think he counts our sins when we confess them to Him out of a sincere and pure and repentant heart...but we should not be running and stumbling into sin...thats what the Holy Spirit is for, He convicts us and guides us away from sin, so we wont stumble over and over...if you dont have convictions or the inner witness of the Holy Spirit, then you need to examine whether or not you know Jesus...because those that know Him hear His voice...The Lord disciplines the ones He loves....so when you arent being disciplined...be afraid...and seek Him out of a pure heart.....ok..let me stop talking now...email me if you want me to continue...i hope you are blessed.....3	What's your favorite Color (for a school project)?

Women can join the military if they want but they aren't forced to like men.  Does the military really not want them? You can say that.  If the truth were to come out, women, for the most part, are a pain the the as*s for the military establishment. In administrative rolls, they do fine and are extremely efficient.  As combatants they are high maintenance and unreliable.  Oh, there are exceptions to that rule, but watch the eyes glaze over on any platoon sergeant when you announce to him that he will have women in his platoon.\nUnfortunately for the military, it has become the dumping ground for every politically correct or set aside program adopted by the government.  It has no choice but to do as the dumb as*s politicians want because the spineless generals still don't know how to stand up to as*sholes like Donald Rumsfeld.\nI often wonder what the outcome would have been if Rumsfeld tried to push his meely mouthed agenda on someone like George Patton.  It's my guess that they would both have to go to the hospital, to get Patton's boot out of Rumsfeld's as*s.7	IRISH ROCK BANDS  they all forget?

Actually, Lybia has been working for many years to get off of the list. The list of State Supporters of Terrorism is compiled by the US State Department, and it is based on many different things, one of which includes attempts at acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn addition to reaching a financial understanding with the families of the Lockerbee tragedy, in the last few years Lybia has renounced their stockpile of various weapons and has invited international inspection. The Lybian government has also stated that it will no longer give monetary and protective aid to international terrorists. \n\nTo answer your other question, the Venezuelan government continues to offer monetary and protective support to leftist guerillas and terrorists in Columbia, which does a great deal to extending the tragedy in that part of the world. Yes, part of the problem between the USA and Venezuela is economic, part is personal, but part is also about the legitimate danger of terrorism to the region.4	I am getting a laptop for Christmas and need internet?

The body will go to muscle tissue to use for fuel.  \nYes, you will lose weight, but it will be muscle mass, not fat. That message flips a metabolic switch that tells the body to store whatever comes in as FAT - fat storage mode - to protect the body.  That means that no matter what you consume, no matter if it's good for you or bad... gets stored as fat.   \nMuscle weighs twice as much as fat. Think of the volume that a pound of lead takes up, vrs a pound of feathers. \nMuscle dictates your metabolism.  If you add a pound of muscle\nto your body it uses up 30 - 50 calories per day at rest.  Example - two people can weigh the exact same amount and the one with the higher muscle mass will look fit and the one with the higher body fat will look fat.\nEducate yourself on a healthy diet and exercise. Avoid trend diets - liquid, meal replacement, high protein, no carb...  etc.  Go on line and find a healthy eating plan that you can stick to for LIFE not for a few months. \nWeight training will increase your muscle mass. Concentrate on increasing your muscle mass rather than losing weight.5	What is the best club to use when trying to hit out of a bunker?  It all depends on the lie and the deepness or flatness of the bunker. Mostly you would use a sand wedge, but I have seen pro's putt out of a green side bunker. It also depends on where the bunker is. If it is a fairway bunker, you may choose any iron and again, I have seen pro's hit a wood out of a bunker if the lie is good and they have quite a distance to the green.9	If a liberal is alone in a forest and there's no one around to hear him/her, does he/she stop lying?  2	what is the best way to loose weight quick?  exercise, salad, walking, dancing and a quick visit to you Doctor to make sure everything is working in your body9	Do you support the President even after he lied to you and me???  hahaha... amyza29... always blaming Clinton... it's too bad Bush can't run his own presidency and has to blame everything that goes wrong on Clinton... you would think in 6 years they would be able to fix some of the screw ups, but apparently not, it's all blamed on Clinton... hahaha\n\nAnd he's done so much to fix those CIA screw-ups... nominate a person who knows nothing about it, about to nominate another... gee he sure is fixing things now...hahahaha\n\nzombiesatemyballs....

Prices for Six Flags have gone up again, at least at Great America. $54.99??? That's ridiculous! I'm assuming they're raising it because the want people to buy the Season Pass, which is $94.99. This is why I go to Cedar Point every summer- THEY actually lowered their prices to $34.99 and they have better roller-coasters! Shame on you Great America. As the price of supplies continue to rise,,, more and more organizations will find themselves having to raise prices to cover the cost of operations. The gasoline prices are not helping any because the cost of delivery is sky rocketing. It is also a matter of simple supply and demand.

GO TO YOUR DOCTOR!!!!  \n\nYou are NOT at risk for swelling your throat shut!\n\nThere is NO reason to wait it out/suffer! A good doctor will put you on steroids (such as Prednisone) for 14 to 21 days! (less time will lead to a rebound of your symptoms thus making you feel worse!).  With the steroid your rash will markedly deminish and you will feel better and look better!\n\nRemember that urushiol poisoning (i.e. poison ivy/oak) is NOT contagious! In other words you cannot transmit it to someone else via your rash! The urushiol toxin is tranmissible by direct contact with the sap/leaf of the plant. This sap stays on your clothes, pet hair etc. (wash all effected clothing in hot, soapy water!). The urushiol binds within 10 minutes of contact so if you KNOW you just brushed up against the plant wash IMMEDIATELY otherwise you are "screwed!"  You will not know you have been otherwise effected until 3 days post exposure when the rash appears.  This is special type of allergic reaction that, unlike hives, does not begin for 48 to 72 hours (it's called a Type 4 reaction and involves your T cells but you can look that up if you want).  It usually starts at the site of exposure but can spread any/everywhere on the body.  Benedryl/Vistiril helps with itching but steroids are needed for true relief! (just remember that if your doctor puts you on less than a 14 day course he/she doesn't know what they are doing regarding this allergic type reaction!). Steroid cream and antihistamine creams are also useful but do NOT use a high potency steroid on your face unless you like a lot of redness and possibly cataracts!\nIn the future there are several products on the market that help prevent the rash by creating a barrier on you skin.  \nAlso, be extremely careful when burning wood for a campfire. The worst cases of urushiol exposure I have seen came from the smoke of unwitted burning of poison Ivy/oak leaves/branches! The person inhaled some of the stuff and you can imagine how bad off they were...\n\nGood Luck! I hope this helps!\n\nGreg M.D.0	What is telephone sex??????????????  you talk dirty to each other while you play with yourself9	What does"MSM/DP" mean in today's political context?

I'm sort of freaked out by the "Conor McNamara 2026" episode. Was this just a weird, horrible, stupid episode, or am I missing something? Was it a dream, or did this all really happen? Can someone else weigh in? You are missing the fact that Joely Richardson had family difficulties during taping so they had to come up with away to send her off with what was going on in the story at the time. So a storm comes into Florida and destroys much of the area. Shawn is dreaming most of what is going on in the episode because he has just told Julia that he cheated on her. He has just told her that he had a cleff palate as a boy. He has just operated on Connor's hand and is ready to move on to hand number two. He has alot on his mind. Connor, Marlo, Christian, Matt, Julia, Anne and his father. He is afraid that many of their choices will backfire.\nOne thing to notice is they wrote in nothing about Kimber or the baby. What they wrote about is Anne having issues with her Princess party, Matt following in his fathers' footsteps, Connor thinking like Shawn that he ruined his parents' marriage, and Julia still having a relationship with Marlo even after they broke up in the last episode. In short this one long nightmare in the midst of the storm. When the storm is over, however, they are talking about having to rebuild things and that takes times. They are talking allegoically about their relationship and about the city damage.  Julia flies off to New York with the children and Shawn stays behind to clean things up in Miami. Colin Redgrave, Joely's uncle was near death with cancer and her daughter had a serious leg injury. That meant she needed time off to take care of thing.5	Can the on-field officials consult video replay to resolve a close call or goal?  No. That is not permitted by FIFA.7	Solve these puzzles:?

DO yo recommend that I download the vista Rc2 to my system. no i do not, because if you do you will have some vista files that cannot be installed on xp, or you might just love vista, but after you install vista RC1, because it is free, it will expire one day after about 6 months from the date you install it, and if you do now buy an upgrade disk for windows vista, the computer will now boot up and you will have to sweep the hard drive with the disk that came with the manufacturer of you computer, but if you do that you will not have any of your  files that were on xp or vista, you will only have a clean install of microsoft windows xp, and what i am saying is that would not be a wise decision to upgrade your computer to vista RC2, if you want to upgrade it buy the disc from microsoft when vista comes out.2	how can i relieve stress.besides going to the gym! i want to stay home and relieve stress! w/ospending my cash i have alot of stress right now sex :)9	Do you have rights to not have a social worker come to your room as a patient in CA.? Because I am having a baby and I was in the hospital before during my pregnancy and one came, disturbing me asking me all kinds of questions, what for I don't know. But i felt like I was being violated of my human rights. Can anyone answer that has sources. You were being assessed by a Public Health Nurse.  They did this to me when I was 25, married, & we had no insurance, yet we planned to pay the hospital bill ourselves (& DID)!  They explained to me that they just wanted to "make sure" that I had the necessary skills to care for my baby.  They even went so far as to show up at our home & when I refused to let them in, they threatened to take our baby away from us!  This happened in 1979 & we referred to it as the local "witch hunt", because the County where we lived was taking children away at an alarming rate for the strangest things, like breast feeding & allowing your baby to sleep in the parents bed!  You have a right to refuse any & all questions until you have a representative in the room with you (anyone will qualify).  Talk to your Doctor & have them make a notation on your chart that you are not to be bothered when you are actually IN the hospital.  Many times, they do this to make sure you are the same person, if there is an identity problem or question once your baby is born & someone tries to remove it from the premises.  They are definately a wierd bunch & the questions they ask should be done in a different manner with a lot more info for the parent/s.  Always ask everyone who has contact with you for their photo ID & it is a good idea to jot their name down in a notebook with the date, time, place,& general description of that person in case anything does happen to your baby & the authorities can track down people who may be there to commit a crime.  There are a LOT of Predators in Hospitals who pose as staff members & go un-noticed due to the high volume of people & traffic in the Hospitals.  You should talk to the HEAD NURSE about this .5	germany will win their march,will they? brief me if they will Against Argentina ..

According to Pfizer's website, the brain can be controlled by electrical signals. Also, everything we sense goes through the brain, so in a sense it is possible to have a sense of reality with electrical signals pounding the brain. A good example would be the Matrix which plugs in humans to get energy from them by putting them in a dream world. This is being done to a limited extent in vision research-People have had microelectrode arrays implanted on the surface of the visual cortex of the brain, connected to a video camera.  The signal from the video camera activates the visual cortex, and these people, many of who have no eyes at all, or totally destroyed optic nerves, are able to "see" simple objects.  Thus, it is a proven concept that electrical signal can feed in meaningful information, and that information can lead to behaviour changes.  For many years, simple electrodes have been used to elicit specific tastes, memories, musclular twitches, etc.  As to your specific question-in order to control people's behaviour..in other words to overcome their will and wishes, and make them do things, or think things, that the operator of the machine wishes, would require a very good understanding of what controls our actions, emotions, and thoughts.  It's very unlikely that we will be at that state in 10-20 years.  Perhaps in 50 years we will have a very basic understanding, and in 100 years a fairly good understanding.  At any rate, when we do understand that, then it would be a relatively simple step to control it electronically (since electronics is simpler than the brain, and would also be advancing over that 100 years).5	What is a Scull in the sport of rowing???

How can any one have victory when the country of Iraq was "invaded" and no war declared. Victory over what? Ideologies, religion, people, a theory, or a decomocratic government based on western ideologies which appear never to work in Islamic societies. You are comparing apples to oranges. first off, Japan never had a formal declaration of war against the US. They just sneaked in and attacked us.  Because the Islamic ideology is different, and that a radical group can and does control a vast majority, only proves that if one of the Imams openly said " go to America and begin killing infidels", there would be more immigrants coming across the border just to kill Americans.3	Any math majors out there?

I was sick for about 3 days, vomiting for about 6 hrs. straight and severe stomach pain and weakness after for about 48 hrs. after. During this time my husband acted like he was mad I was sick and never offered to help with anything.  We have a 6 yr old boy of whom I continued to help the best I could.  One little task of doing the dishes, sweeping the floor or throwing in a load of laundry would have been a big help.  This is the thing:  he believes I should always ask, I say under certain circumstances he should be kind and offer, what is your opinion? Sounds to me like you have a 6 year old son, and a 2 year old for a  husband. You should have ASKED him? Please, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard a grown man say...and he was SERIOUS! I'm not saying you need to get a divorce because of this, but when you get to feeling better, you need to sit Mr man down, and have a long, open talk with him. He had better grow up, and soon, or he is going to be alone! Good Luck!!3	I want to work in a court setting.  What field of study should i do?

These days, it's tough to go wrong.\n\nJust to start out with some perspective, during the winter in Southern California the water gets down to the mid to high 50's. Sometimes it'll pop back up to the low 60's for a few days. Other days it'll drop down to the low 50's. \n\nAnd since (as you well know) water temps are controlled by currents and ocean swells, even in the summer it can get pretty chilly.\n\nSo, with that said, here are my suggestions:\n\nFor the winter months, get yourself a good 2/3 fullsuit (most surfing wetsuits are a different thickness in the arms/legs than in the torso, the logic being that your arms and legs need more flexibility). A 2/3 has 2mm thick arms/legs and 3mm thick torso. \n\nThe best fullsuits on the market are widely considered to be the Rip Curl "Bomb" series and the O'Neill "Psycho" series. Xcel, Hotline, Hurley, Quiksilver and Billabong all make good suits, but 80% of the guys in the water here wear Rip Curl or O'Neill.  \n\nThe Rip Curl "Bomb" series comes in two versions - the "E-Bomb" and the "F-Bomb". They're basically identical suits except that the F-Bomb is coated inside the torso section with this fuzzy insulation stuff, which supposedly keeps your mid-section a bit warmer. The E-Bomb doesn't have the coating and is 100% pure "Elastomax", which is this super squishy, stretchy neopreme. \n\nRight now I'm using a 2/3 E-Bomb. I find it to be astonishingly warm. However, I also have a 2/3 O'Neill Psycho II. It's made of an almost identical super stretchy material. \n\n6 months ago I would have suggested the O'Neill over the Rip Curl because they always seemed to be better constructed (the Rip Curls have always been more flexible, but had a tendency to start falling apart after a few months). However, with this new E-Bomb, I stand corrected. It's just as sturdy as the Psycho II. Maybe even better. \n\nOne more factor to consider is the fit. I've always found O'Neill wetsuits to be a bit tighter fitting than the Rip Curl. Then again, I'm on the bigger side (at least as far as surfers go). While you want your suit to be as snug and form-fitting as possible, a few wrinkles here and there can sometimes equal a bit of extra free movement.  \n\nAgain though, I'm nit-picking. Bottom line:\n\n2/3 O'Neill Psycho II\n2/3 Rip Curl F-Bomb\n\nYou can't go wrong with either one. If you get cold easily, go up one thickness. OR, just pick up some booties for those really cold mornings. \n\nCheck out the Rip Curl store in San Clemente or check out Jack's Surfboards in Huntington Beach. Both have a MASSIVE selection of suits. Or just order online. \n\nQuick note: If you plan on surfing in the Fall/Spring, your 2/3 fullsuit will still work beautifully and keep you extra warm. \n\nBUT, if you have the extra cash and like the idea of shedding a little rubber when the conditions warm up, get a short-sleeved "comp" (used to stand for "competition wetsuit" back when they inroduced them in the 80's). The only drawback to the comp is that you can get a nasty farmer's tan on your arms.

What benifit is it that women do not grow beards, but men do? I think the scientific jury is still out on that one, but in my unscientific opinion, the answer is obvious: as the human male brain developed and evolved, so did its sense of beauty which began to include women, and women without facial hair just began to look more beautiful to men than those with it.\n\nIt was and is just one more way to differentiate women from men so to allow the 2 sexes to be attracted to each other.\n\nThat's why homosexuality is so unnatural.\n\nThink about it, if men and women looked almost the same, what would attract us to each other?\n\nIt is our differences that attract the 2 sexes, not similarities.8	im 13 and im a b in bra size!!! do u think that big or sexi?  woooow! it is REALLY sexy. especially if it fits in mouth.3	I need help finding the perfect major in college that i know i can relate to, what website can i get help at?

First off, I read that the question was about an upset stomach, not about cramps.  Cramps is a completely different thing.\n\nMenstrual cramps are pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen just before or during a menstrual period. Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for menstrual cramps. \n\nAn upset stomach is just that.  The symptoms of an upset stomach include occasional heartburn, indigestion, a taste of bile in the mouth, pains in the stomach, nausea and then there is Gastritis - meaning inflammation of the stomach.\n \nWhen you menstruate your hormones can over-stimulate the emesis centers of the brainstem resulting in frequent upset stomach. In pregnancy this is known as "morning sickness", this uncomfortable problem tends to be worse when you first wake up, but can happen any time of the day.  Try eating crackers or smaller, more frequent meals.  Try to keep track of what you eat and see if a particular food might be causing it.  Some of the "troublesome foods are coffee, citrus fruits, fatty foods, spicy foods, onions, alcohol and chocolate.4	how do i hack into another computer? i've searched on web and cant find any good sites.

Each room contains a person and hence the hotel is full since all rooms and all people stretch to infinity.\n\nNow a coach turns up with 10 more people looking for rooms. How does the hotel manager fit the ten new people into his hotel? An excellent question.  Here's what to do:\n\nCoach sends the first guy to room #1 and tells him to say "Coach says this is my room.  Move to the next one, and pass it on."  So he moves into room #1 and bumps the guy in #1 to #2, who bumps the guy in #2 to #3, etc.  \n\nIn most hotels, you eventually get to a guy who was bumped out of his room and has no place to go because he was in the last room and the hotel was full, causing a problem.  But this is Hotel Infinity, so that kind of problem can never happen, even when every single room in the hotel has somebody in it, because there is no last room.  \n\nAs soon as the first guy gets moved into room #1, coach sends the next new guy into room #1 and bumps everybody again, just like you just did.  When coach gets his 10 new guys moved in, he hits the showers.2	why are alchoholics considered to have a disability but drug addicts aren't?

Is the disk being detected in My Computer?\n\nIf it is, try playing it in another player, such as RealPlayer, Itunes, etc. If it works there, then there's something wrong with your Windows Media Player Setup.\n\nYou might think about updating to WMP 11. If you don't feel like changing that, you can try to see if your Windows Media Player 10 needs to be reinstalled.\n\nThat's all I can give without knowing the above.

It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.5	Does anyone know where the All Blacks are staying when they are in Brisbane on the 29 July?

I am a 23 year-old female (although I am told I look about 18 or 19) and I am 5'2" and I weigh 95 lbs. I have weighed that for about 2 yrs. now. I eat like any other person does who is of average weight, but I know I am supposed to be at least 110 lbs. Before I asked on here how to gain weight, since that has not worked, now my question is: is this normal? I have gotten tested for hyperthyroidism and I don't have it. I menstruate regularly so I know I can't be that unhealthy. I really don't understand why for a 23 year-old I weigh just 95 lbs., it really does not make sense b/c in highschool at age 16 I weighed 106! I am back to the same weight that I was at age 14!

If you mean serious whitening, a dentist or over the counter whitening treatments are the best bet.  Whitening toothpastes can help, but won't make big changes.

IT IS SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL USED IN WATER TREATMENT Definition for NH3-N\nAmmonia Nitrogen - an inorganic, dissolved form of nitrogen that can be found in water, but in the presence of oxygen will convert to nitrate.\n\nAmmonia (NH3-N) \nan inorganic form of nitrogen, is contained in fertilizers, septic system effluent, and animal wastes. It is also a product of bacterial decomposition of organic matter. Ammonia NH3-N (NH3-N) becomes a concern if high levels of the un-ionized form are present. In this form NH3-N can be toxic to aquatic organisms. The presence of un-ionized ammonia is a function of the NH3-N concentration, pH, and temperature. Conversion of NH3-N to nitrite nitrogen by nitrification requires large quantities of oxygen which can kill aquatic organisms due to the lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations in water. NH3-N concentrations are reported in mg/L NH3-N.6	Is Usability Engineering or Marketing?  Usability would fall under engineering in my opinion.

So it can be unsettling to learn of global phenomena that are inherently unstable, unpredictable. Such is the case with the Earth's magnetic field. Every so often, our planet's magnetic poles reverse polarity . Compass needles have always pointed north; in a reversal, they would point south. \n\nYou could perhaps take comfort in the knowledge that these reversals happen infrequently—on average every 250,000 years—but maybe not when you consider that it's been over 700,000 years since the last reversal, and the next one may be currently underway. \n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is created deep within our planet's outer core through a complex, self-sustaining interaction known as the "geomagnetic dynamo" . In the 1980s, Gary Glatzmaier, now at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Paul Roberts of the University of California, Los Angeles, began work on a computer model that simulates this interaction. By 1995, they had created a model that not only created a self-sustaining magnetic field , but after simulating the passage of 36,000 years, the field it generated spontaneously flipped.0	How do you think religion has changed since 30 years ago?

You know he was nice may be the first couple weeks , flowers ,chocolate , kissing my hand and phone calls...... Now, i dont see any of that. he calls me once every week , and we wouldn't talk more than 15 minuts sometimes 40 minutes if he is doing grocery shopping!! because he is claiming that his career is very important and it's taking all his time. we meet once or twice by weekly!! when we meet all we do is hanging out in his house for his pleasur or going out for  dinner. I like the guy and feel that he needs alot of care and love that he missed all his life( divorced parents),but at the same time i dont feel he cares that much about me so I dont want to put my feeling on the table. should i continue with him , cuz he might change or should i forget all about him he dosnt seem serious!! thanks for reading . This sounds like a completely one-sided relationship.  You're always there when he calls.  If he wants to have sex, you're in the mood too.  If he wants to see you, you're available.  What about your needs and desires?  You give him everything he wants and in return you get _________?  If he wanted to see you more often, he'd find a way.  I say, stop being so available to him all the time.  Miss a phone call or two- and be too busy when he finally wants to go to dinner, and see if he fights for your attention.  If he doesn't, it's clear he's not into you any more, and it's time for you to stop wasting your time.  I mean really.  Don't you feel like a babysitter sometimes?  Don't your legs get tired, running after this guy?  Certainly, there is another man out there who will give you the affection you deserve.2	What is the most effective method of monitoring the cardiovascular system  when a patient has suffered severe? this question is about a burn victim In most cases, via an intraaortic catheter during the acute phase of recovery.

Our dad was an abusive guy and contributed to our mom's death.  The authorities took us and gave us way to foster parents.  My sister ended up living with wealthy influential people while I grew up with aunt and uncle on a farm.  \n\nDue to strange circumstances and problems with the government my sister and I came together not knowing each other.  I thought she was hot not knowing who she was but she was in love with some pilot.  Even after we figured out that we were related I still think she is hot.  \n\nI have to go face our evil dad now.  He is a high up officer in the military now.  \n\nShould I persue a relationship with my sister or just turn gay and be with her boyfriend pilot's buddy?

The ASVAB is device used by the military to determine where your talents might be best utilized. I personally believe that talent cannot be measured but that's just me. As a former Navy type, I can tell you that after boot camp you will probably be offered the opportunity to try to qualify for consideration for BUDS training. In the early 80's, at NAS Millington A school, you signed up to attend a tryout for BUDS, we marched over to the base swimming pool and were promptly half drowned by a group of very zealous Seals. This is just a preliminary to see if;\n1.       You can swim\n2.       If you panic\n3.       How much heart you have.\n\nIt does not qualify you for anything, other than a second look.\nBUDS candidates are a fairly select group of people, gleened from a much larger school of tadpoles, but even they get thinned out significantly. As a group these guys, contrary to movies, already tend to be highly intelligent though (this is not determined by an ASVAB but by a process) and have an incredible amount of perserverance, guts and determination. The process is designed to weed out those that think like individuals, don't take direction exactly (also what bootcamp does), and can reach into thier gut and find strength when they don't have the steam for more abuse. This is only BUDS, these folks are not neccesarily SEALS, From my point of view, these folks are more than remarkable, my hat is off to them.\n\nIf this is something your looking at doing, the entire military, and the Navy especially (Don't let a jarhead, air force puke, grunt, or a beach comber Coastie tell you different.), is a good life and offers opportunities you can't get anywhere else on the planet. I wish you success in your endeavor.4	What kind of site is ghhovrst.org ? This or a similar site sometimes shows up in searchs. How do I\naccess the info or join the group?

Also are they any other player switching teams, and if so, where they going? I live in Indiana and trust me Jermaine's staying. Only way he'll go is if the Pacers get a trade they can pass up. Only possibilities to me are Chicago.  Some reports have the Bulls packaging Chandler, Ben Gordon and the No. 2 pick to the Wolves for Garnett or to the Pacers for O'Neal.\nI just moved to Minnesota and also Kevin Garnett is most liekly staying. he is the centerpiece ofthe franchise and city and there's no way he'll go.

It's just that, I'm kind of sick of it in school. People sometimes come up to me after we receive our tests and they say, "What did you get on your test?" If I get a low grade, they run back to their friends and say, "Oh I got a higher grade than her!" or something of that nature. \n\nSome people also say, "It's the apocalypse!" when I miss a question. I don't want to be a nerd but sometimes when the rest of the people in the class are asleep, it's hard to just have the teacher waiting... Should I just keep quiet even if I know the answer, or should I say it? I don't automatically label asians as smart, there are smart people in every race and i'm sure that all asians are not smart.\n\nIf you know the answer to a question go ahead and answer it if you want to, you shouldn't let others affect your education - in the future when you're working they wont be there with you.2	Does anyone know what echo means on a ultrasound? I was sent for a mammogram and then sent for a ultrasound and they found a new spot and said there was echo around it and to come back in 3 months, to see if there was any changes. Ultrasounds are actually the reading of digitized echos, like bats use to find objects in the dark. Or like sonar.\n\nAn "echo" in an ultrasound reading would be similar to a "shadow" in a photograph, and may mean nothing at all. If they told you to wait 3 months, there is almost definitely nothing to suggest a new cancer, but you can always ask the doc who ordered it to explain further.6	sources of funding small scale enterprices.? sources of fund in small scale enterprices 1/  Traditional lenders such as banks etc. Most will have programs for small business loans.\n\n2/  Through the Small Business Administration.

Theodore Roosevelt 19071	how can loop diuretics cause metabolic alkalosis?  The process is a bit complex, but I'll walk you through it step-by-step.\n\nLoop diuretics block the Na/K/Cl co-transporters in the distal nephron. This causes a decrease in the reabsorption of chloride ions and therefore, increases the luminal electronegativity of the distal nephron.  The increase in luminal electronegativity allows excessive 'wasting' of both hydrogen and potassium ions, as these cations will be attracted to the relatively negative charge in the lumen.  Over time, the depletion of cations (particularly hydrogen ions) causes the plasma pH to increase (i.e. alkalosis).  \n\nBecause both potassium and hydrogen ions are lost in this process, the phenomenon is generally refer ed to as 'hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis'.3	spelling of fourty(40) is it right or wrong?  forty0	What do you Gay men mean when you say I'm a top only? I'm assuming that is related to the only way you have sex.  Seems to me that a real homosexual would do it all ways. \nSo a top only will only date a bottom only?  God that would suck! It's like saying, I'm a hairdresser, but I don't cut hair, I only wash it.  Anyway, I've always wondered what you guys really ment by a "top only" If a gay man is a top only, it means he will not receive anal sex, he will only give it. This can also mean that he will only recieve oral sex, he will not give it.\n\nSometimes it reflects a man's personal tastes (just like some heterosexual men don't like giving oral sex and some do), but other times it can reflect on the feelings he has on what it means to be a 'real man'. There's a stereotype that "real men" don't receive anal sex or give oral sex to another man, that doing those acts are demeaning and degrading and only for [insert derogatory slang term for gay men here].\n\nThere's another twist to this. If a man is on the "down low", a phrase that African-American men use to talk about being a closeted gay or bisexual (often times even closeted to themselves), and about the gay sex they have in these situations, then for some reason they believe that if they only top, then they're not gay or bi.\n\nI hope this helps.9	Why do you hate bush?

I am starting my 4th year of Medical School at UT San Antonio in Texas.  I am lucky because Texas offers its residents the least expensive medical school in the US with tuition and fees of about 11K to 12 K per year.  Books, living expenses, etc...all add up of course, but the federal student loan program allows anyone who is willing to live frugally (my budget for living expenses on loans only is about 1500 per month and this is not difficult to do) the ability to borrow all that is necessary to pay for school and live.  You will be borrowing probably 150K over the 4 years, but you can consolidate and pay it back over long enough that it is do-able if you really want to do it.  \n\nAnother option is the military program.  Any branch of the military offers a stipend that will basically give you the same amount of money that loans do per month, pay for tuition, fees and books and in exchange you will pay back year for year to the military.  So, you will not be in any debt at all when you complete your time committment to the military.  They are recruiting strongly now and allow many things, such as older than usual or past medical histories of some things, that they would not have allowed in the past.  This is a good option if you are not comfortable with debt.\n\nAs for how difficult it is to get in my advice is this.  When I decided to apply some people laughed at me and said I would never make it because I was a fine arts major and went to a smaller, less than impressive undergraduate school, but I DID get in and if you really want to - you will too.  Check the school web sites for necessary prerequisites and time lines to apply, do some volunteer work or work as an orderly or something like that in a hospital - this will prove that you are motivated, and then take the MCAT entrance exam (I HIGHLY recommend a preparation course prior to taking this exam - they are MORE than worth the money).  Apply - if you don't get in the first try - go in person to talk with someone in the admissions department at a medical school and talk with them openly about your application.  Take their advice and re-apply.  We need good doctors.  So, if you feel the calling, don't let anything get in your way!5	In your opinion, what does today's wrestling business need to impress its fans?

But if you are really concerned there are some blood test that your doctor can order to check for inflammatory conditions that may be causing the pain.

Considering how badly the yank needed us.????? Your questions and comments indicate a great degree of cluelessness concerning Royal Navy operations in the Pacific Theatre.\n\nI'll try and address your comments in the order that you made them:\n\n\n"gentlemen, gentlemen aren't we forgetting that the british navy steamed with the americans for the entire pacific campaign??\nIn fact the british carriers were the only ones to have steel decks, therefore making them a little more durable during jap kamikarzi attacks????"\n\nFirst off, the RN did NOT steam with the USN during the entire Pacific Campaign.  From the time of Nagumo's carrier raids in the Indian Ocean in April 1942 until operations against targets in the Far East Indies starting in April 1944, the RN didn't operate with the USN at all, with the exception of the loaning of HMS Victorious to the USN towards the end of the Guadalacanal campaign due to the carrier losses suffered by the USN.  She didn't see any action, so that's pretty much 2 whole years where the RN did nothing to support the USN in the Pacific.\n\nThe RN carriers did have armored decks, and they were fairly effective against kamikaze raids.  However, they made a severe trade-off because the armored decks reduced the size of the hangar decks, and RN carriers typically carried an air group only half the size of their USN counterparts, which limited the usefulness of their air groups.\n\n"My grandfather was an officer on the Indfatigable, the largest aircraft carrier this country built, certainly during the war, and the whole company of 5000+ men are forgotten......."\n\nYour grandfather was a fine man for serving, and has my utmost respect for doing so.\n\nI don't know where you get the 5000+ figure from, the Implacable class carriers had a designed crew of 1,585, but actually had a complement near 2,300 during actual service, which is still not even half your figure.\n\n"austrailia was never a target, the japs had no intention of overstretching them selves they were only after the mineral and oil reserves of the philipeans.... get a grip man. the fact that the british fleets pacific home was austraila says that the country would have been defended..."\n\nYet the British Pacific Fleet wasn't established until 22 November 1944, who was defending Australia up til then?  Not the previous British Far Eastern Fleet, as the were based in the Maldives and were of no use to Australia.   You are correct in saying that the Japanese wouldn't have invaded Australia, they simply didn't have the resources, logistical support, or the troops to do so.\n\n"as for the early british losses the japs took us by surprise too, but that was nothing to the incompetence of pearl habour, where as luck would have it the carriers were out on exercise. The americans knew they were coming and did nothing."\n\nWhat about the loss of Princes of Wales and Repulse?  No surprises there, it was simply hubris and incompotence which led to them making a sortie with no air support and a miniscule destroyer escort in the face of large numbers of shore-based Japanese bombers.\n\nI think the question you should have asked is:\n\n"Why is there such a paucity of books concerning Royal Navy opeartions in the Pacific and Indian Ocean Theaters during WWII?"\n\nIn my humble opinion that would have been a better question which would have yielded more fruitful answers.\n\nOh, and I would like to know why bearstirringfromcave thinks RN carrier design was superior to USN carrier design?  (And the experiences in the Med didn't have much to do with it, as they changed almost nothing in their carrier designs even after the Med was secure).9	If you had $1,000.00 to donate today to any charity  or organization, which would you choose and why?

Can anyone with polycystic ovaries give me some advice?I have been going to the dictors for tests about pco and i dont know whats going on i have had two blood tests and they havent got back to me yet.Does it make you infertile or is it har to have children?Iam eighteen and i dont want kids at the moment ...what will happen in the future.Iam worried. PCO is when the eggs in your monthly cycle fails to release and developes into a bubble(simply put). The more eggs that fail to release forms into more and more bubbles that form a cluster and that is where the term poly(means many) began to form on the ovary.  Each month a woman has an egg released and when it does not fully mature and travel the normal process it stops and stays on the ovary, again forming a cluster.  So having PCO means many cyst on your ovary and it woul stand out on an ultrasound, looking exactly like a cluster of grapes but only a doctor can read the ultrasound.  As far as i know the only treatment for it is removal of the whole ovary.  If you had it the doctor would have told you the time you had the US.  So it may be nothing to worry about.  I know I had to have my right one remove DEC last year.  You only need one ovary to have a child as long as that one ifs functioning properly and releasing an egg or two :).

To quote the Skeptic's Dictionary:\n\n"There are some skeptics who argue that the facts do not support the legend, that there is no mystery to be solved, and nothing that needs explaining.The number of wrecks in this area is not extraordinary, given its size, location and the amount of traffic it receives. Many of the ships and planes that have been identified as having disappeared mysteriously in the Bermuda Triangle were not in the Bermuda Triangle at all. Investigations to date have not produced scientific evidence of any unusual phenomena involved in the disappearances. Thus, any explanation, including so-called scientific ones in terms of methane gas being released from the ocean floor, magnetic disturbances, etc., are not needed.

National Lending Corp.? Theres this company @ www.mynlc.com and it's about being a mortgage loan officer. You make money of someones succesful loan. Then when you recruit people, you get overides and more money. Has any one done this? Is this a real thing? I'ts no exp. nec and they'll train you. What do you think? And ther's a $200 investment for a software and background check. You need to be licensed in most states to be a mortgage broker.  This sounds like a scam.  Sorry, but I'd stay away from it if I were you.  Unlicensed activity can also get you heavy penalties from the state bureau of licensing if your state requires mortgage brokers to be licensed.6	what's the difference between corporate chains and voluntary chains?  voluntary chains are independent ownership retailers [like true value hardware and ACE hardware] and corporate chains are common ownership chains [like PUBLIX or FOOD LION]4	Is there any spyware removal download out there that really works?

What I need is a set of 20 zero's and then 5 one's all in a randomized list.  Without using SAS.  Thanks If you are actually referring to the so called binomial distribution (0 or 1 with a pre-defined propability for each) then you need a sample of 25 where for all samples independently p(0)=0.8, p(1)=0.2. There are many ways to achieve this using excel, statistics packages or a dice.\n\nTry, for example, rolling a die and assuming:\n1 -> 1\n2-5 -> 0\n6 -> reroll\n\nThat will generate a sample from the Binomial distribution. \n\nIf you really want what you exactly described (ie arbitrary arrangement of 20 0s and 5 1s) then you need a random permutation. This, too, is relatively easy to do with a computer. You can even simulate it with the a die with the\nfollowing change:\n\nIf you roll\n1 -> 1\n2-5 -> 0\n6 -> reroll\nBUT If you get a total of 5 ones, stop rolling and consider all the rest to be zeros.\n\nNote that the permutations obtained this way are not uniformly distributed (i.e. some are more propable than others) but they are randomly distributed. \n\nFinally, here's an arbitrary list, generated in a pseudo-random manner (using a computer):\n 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 09	Which British military unit had a black panther as an emblem or badge?

We could take all of that $$ and energy that we put toward "border control" and put it to use somewhere else-like the real war we are fighting in Iraq. Anyway, yes we should allow it. We should own Mexico, we practically do anyway-they are in debt up to their ears with us. And we are paying for their illegal citizens to come live in our country. We are paying double! It would save time and money if we just encompassed them into us. We're both bilingual countries anyway. I don't see that it would make that much of a difference to us. To Mexico it would.7	Do your cry publicly or alone?  I rarely cry, As a man, I don't feel the need too very often. I am not saying that women shouldn't or that they are weak because they do. I just don't get very emotional. If I do get to the point to where I am crying then I really don't care who is around. I am a grown up and if I think I should cry then hopefully people won't see me as a child or to emotional but if they do then they don't have very many brains and are very ill educated. Crying is a very important part of life and I think it is a healthy thing to do some times.2	which one is more severe: Bipolar I or Bipolar II.........?  No real answer.

I recently saw a commercial made by gatorade that stated that the NASCAR drivers lose up to 10 pounds every race because their car is so hot, and they start to sweat a lot.  I was wondering that if I started to sweat a lot without doing any type of exercise, will I also lose weight? only water weight, the only way to actually lose fat weight is by doing cardovascular exercise, so running, biking, swimming, rollerblading.  Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

You must understand that the Star Wars universe is set "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away". "A long time ago" has been estimated to be thousands of years ago, so it could not range between 2006-2897 ABY.

I'm not positive on specific companies but...\n\nCheck out the Small Business Administration web site -- they're a great resource for the small business owner. I listed a couple of other handy links as well.\n\nTry reading up on the subject -- check out Amazon, your local bookstore or library. \n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million).0	Which nation is the most annoying, The Americans or the French?  The Americans by far (although I'm in no way prejudiced!)

Also, have you noticed that on a lot of American TV shows, the presenters don't talk - they SHOUT! It gets very annoying...9	What can the United States offer Canada in return for oil?

Beta versions still contain all kinds of things that don't work now and will never work later, but Microsoft can't be bothered fixing them because they want to find out if anyone notices first.\n\n2. Never, ever use the first version. First versions still contain bugs that may or may not get fixed.\n\nStick to an operating system version that has been in use for at least two years -- at least you'll know in advance what the problems are, instead of finding them yourself.2	Is there anything that you can take or put on your skin when you have shingles to help with the pain?

Osma Bin Laden threat the U.S that if we dont leave iraq and afganistan he will terrorize us again. that may mean if he might get north korea to bomb us since they have powerful nuclear bomb. that may mean we will go in to war with other countries and with our allies. and since other countries dont like us they well might join iraq and Osma Bin Laden IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BIN LADEN!!  With every poll showing majorities of Americans both fed up with Bush's war against Iraq and convinced that Bush's invasion of Iraq has made Americans less safe, the White House moron proposes to start another war by attacking Iran. VP Cheney has already ordered the U.S. Strategic Command come up with plans to strike Iran with tactical nuclear weapons.The Bush administration is insane. If the American people do not decapitate it by demanding Bush's impeachment, the Bush administration will bring about Armageddon. This may please some Christian evangelicals conned by Rapture predictions, but World War III will please no one else.What few people today actually discuss is this; just how bad would it be if Iran manages in a few years to create a primitive nuclear weapon or two? Iran has nuclear powers Pakistan and India to its east, and a hostile nuclear Israel to its west. Israel has more nuclear weapons per capita than any nation in the world, and any reading of her history suggests she would not be loath to use them if she felt threatened. Iran's leaders are mean screwballs these days, but not insane; any leader of Iran would know that Israel would destroy their nation and their people should they ever attempt to lob a creaky rivet-popping missile with a warhead of any kind towards Tel Aviv. As to any presumed danger that those nutty Persians will hand over little nukes to "terrorists"--there are a whole bunch of nations right now who are perfectly capable of doing so anyway. Oh, and by the way, how does the nation with the largest nuclear force of all time, who is the only one in history who has used these weapons, whose current mean and somewhat screwball leaders talk of using "tactical" nuclear weapons in their already illegal wars--how does that nation become the one to decide who else gets to join their dandy little club? I say, to our  both parties, lighten up. Iran isn't going to nuke Miami anytime soon.2	How many calories should the average person intake per day?

Erikson, Erik - Pioneering PSYCHOANALYST, much interested in the development of the person throughout the lifespan, rather than simply during childhood. In this respect he differed from other influential theorists such as Sigmund FREUD and Jean PIAGET. Erikson argued that there existed "eight ages of man", each of which had its own characteristic "crisis" (a term which he used in a less negative sense than one might naturally understand it. The crisis of the infant up to the age of eighteen months, for instance, is trust/mistrust of the primary caretaker (usually the mother); the crisis of the "later years" is integrity vs. despair. Particularly influential is Erikson's theory of adolescence, which he believed to be characterised by integrity vs. role confusion. Although many of Erikson's theories have been influential, they have nevertheless also been criticised for their unproveability.8	why do people ask stupid questions? i want to know why? because they want to SARAH ELIZABETH MATTHEWS5	Why is it called the Tournament of Hearts?

I am really scared at night hen all the lights are turned off cause on my moditor it is all sorts of colors on it. And it makes like a screaming kind of sound. I am reall scared! There are many reasons why this could be happening. To give you a more appropriate answer, you would have to be much more specific. For instance, do you have a Widows based computer or a Mac? (If it's crashing I'm assuming Windows). :P  What operating system is installed (ex. Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc.)  Next, we need to know what kind of hardware you have.  Is this a Dell, Gateway, IBM?  What kind of software is installed on the machine?\n\nFor now, I'll give you some ideas.  Perhaps your computer is freezing due to some software you added that is causing problems.  When did the crashes start? If you did not have crashes until after you installed or downloaded a program, that may be the problem. Try to remember, and uninstall any programs that you don't use or need.  \n\nSpyware/Adware/Malware can cause problems for your computer as well. Try to use programs that can detect these and remove them from your system. Some examples are: Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware and Microsoft's Antispyware.\n\nDo you have a good virus scanning program installed?  Viruses can cause problems for your computer. Some examples of Antivirus software are: Norton Antivirus, Panda Antivirus, McAffee Antivirus there are also some free versions out there if you look for them, like AVG.\n\nThese are all software based things to troubleshoot, however, you could also have a hardware problem, like bad sectors on your hard drive or bad memory.\n\nThat may not help you or be too much for you to think about right now.

It all depends on which summer you're referring to.  The season begins on the 21st of June in the northern hemisphere while it begins December 21st in the southern hemisphere.  While for my oldest son, as well as many other children in the area, summer begins with the end of their school day on the 30th of June.  For me, summer is when summer ice begins and I begin to work hockey camps for kids to adults in early July.  And to others, summer begins when it gets hot outside.  To many, it already is summer.9	What does US think UK should do about the upsurge in gun crime ,even though guns are banned in UK.?

I say this is the last season of The Soprano's, my husband says it isn't.  Who's right? This season (season 7) is DEFINITELY the last season. You win the bet, your husband loses!\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, it's official. The Sopranos is finished after this upcoming season which begins March 12th.\n\nDavid Chase, creator and executive producer of the HBO hit series, assured critics Friday at the Television Critics Assn. winter press tour that he won't be coaxed back for more after the 20 episodes he is working on are completed. "That will be the end", Chase said. "Definitely".\n\nThe previous season of Sopranos was intended to be the final episodes, but HBO managed to lure Chase back for more. Twelve new episodes unspool in March, followed by the final eight episodes in January 2007. Chase even scotched the perennial speculation that HBO could produce a theatrical version of the show.7	normajeanorwhat?!?!?!?

In response to Doorman's question on "How to keep and make a man happy".....many answered that some form of "sex" keeps him happy.  Well, how do you make or keep a man happy who DOESN'T WANT SEX?!  Particularly if THE WOMAN DOES?!!!\n\nAnd before you answer: \n* NO! He's not having an affair, and yes I know that for certain.  \n*YES, kids, work, financial strain, & stress from outside sources\n  can affect a man's drive (and we have all 4).  \n*NO, self satisfaction is OUT!  Doesn't work for me, (actually \n  makes it worse with more sexual frustration).  \n*Also NO on finding another sleeping partner, as well as divorce,\n  it's not the solution. I don't want it so much, but again, this goes back to that other question I answered on why people aren't hooking up after they're married, and I think much of the answer is contingent on what people are, and are not, bringing into the bedroom to begin with.  For so long I did want to do stuff, and then I did, and now I'm sort of over that, and really challenged to want to get back into it again.\n\nI'm not quite so sure what it is that I want anymore from that aspect of it, if anything.  Yeah you could spend time with him in other ways and build up those other aspects of the relationship but quite honestly if it just isn't there one would have to ask if there aren't deeper issues plaguing the relationship.

Jokes and anecdotes please! thanx alot I've made five BM speeches, and each one gets better.  The first one was short and terrible, so I understand your friends situation.  An excerpt from a Best Man speech I wrote.  I used this last year:\n\n"The origins of Best Man go back to medieval times, when a man would actually STEAL his bride from a neighboring village.  The best man was a trusted friend, chosen for his superior fighting skills to slay off an attack from the bride's understandably angry family during what they considered to be an abduction, but which the groom preferred to call "the courtship."  During the ceremony, the Best Man stood to the right of the groom so that his fighting hand would be free to fight anyone who still objected to the wedding.  These were dark times indeed - for a left-handed Best Man."\n\nSeeing how this is his first, his best bet is to keep it short and sweet.  Pick an anecdote which many know about, but everyone will get, and by which no one will be offended.   If he feels the crowd is diggin' it, perhaps he can throw in another joke, but if he feels like he's losing the crowd, cut to the toast.5	whos the winning in the battle of manny and erik morales this day nov. 18 in Nevada Las Vegas?  i was told by the supreme being that it will be pacquiao.1	what is the gerber methods?

Every now and then I start yawning again and again, and I can't stop.  I feel like I need more oxygen to stop yawning, so I breath much faster than usual.  Sometimes when I'm breathing faster I feel like I'm getting enough air, and sometimes I don't.  This happened to me today,and after a while I got lightheaded, and my vision got cloudy, but then suddenly it stopped, and I could breath normally again.  This happens every now and then but I don't usually feel light headed, and it always stops suddenly.  What could it be? You are hyperventilating, Dude.

I know that bands release albums that are either LP or EP, and I fairly certain that LP's are full length albums, but what does it stand for and what do they mean? Terms from the days of vinyl records. As I worked in a record store selling Vinyl for 2 years during the 80s, I got to work intimately with them... so...\n\nLP = Long Play (full length album) - 33 1/3 speed\nEP = Extended Play (as in extended from a single) - 33 1/3 speed\nSingle = one song a side - 45 speed\n\nLP records could be a maximum of about 40 minutes with microgrooving, less without.\nEP records were from 3-20 minutes (as I recall).\n\nAn LP could hold 5-6 songs per side.\nAn EP could hold 1-3 (cramped at 3) per side.\nA single could hold one song per side.\n\nHow they were used.  Bands generally used LPs for full length album releases.  EPs were used commonly to release a short album release (a few songs or extended remix singles).  The EP format was also typically used on 12" singles.  12" singles also ran 33 1/3 speed.  45's (singles) were obviously used to release two songs from an album (not usually remixes).\n\nSizes for vinyl include 12", 10" and 7" diameter.  EPs could be 10" or 12".  LPs were only 12".  45's were only 7".  \n\nAnd finally, there were picture disks.  These were a special process to overlay the vinyl grooves on top of a picture.  They were generally heavier and the vinyl didn't hold up as long.  Picture disks were, as I recall, always 12" in size.0	Which religion makes the most sense?  Aaah, "tailor-made god".

Based on my own experience, having saved many a drowning persons life(I work in a bottle depot, it happens).\nMany times you rescue a blonde and she is often in fact a redhead, this is something you encounter in the recycling business a lot(oh I could tell you stories). Many redheads actually dye their topcoat(I am thinking of new and better ways to get past the Yahoo censors). This is a ploy to fool the sun into thinking the redhead is actually a blonde, voila less sunburns, the sun moves on to seek out another more obvious carrot top.\nI have to digress. I would only save one person, the blonde because she is also the redhead.\nIf not ,who cares the world could use one less redhead. Personally I would be gunning for Ron Howard, but I am sure that is just a pipe dream.6	where is the best place to find a new job in hotels and restarants?

Having worked for a Hilton also looked good on my resume because it is a well respected establishment.1	what is the moon's purpose? why is it here? It doesn't really have a purpose in the since that a firefighter has a purpose, but there are consequences of its being there.\n\nThe moon formed when the proto-earth was hit by a Mars sized asteroid during the very early years of the solar system - about 4.5 to 5 billion years ago. The resulting collision knocked a bunch of stuff into orbit around the Earth. That stuff quickly accreted together and the moon was formed.\n\nBecause the Earth has a (relatively speaking) large satellite there are a couple of consequences. Tides are the obvious one. But more important is that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon provide a weak link, but enough of a link that the Moon stabilizes the Earth's rotation. Right now our axis of rotation is about 23.5 degress tilted with respect to our orbital plane. It has probably always been close to this. \n\nWithout a large Moon, the small gravitational tugs from the other planets can lead to an instability where the axis of rotation (relatively) suddenly shifts - maybe from 23 degress to 85 degrees. This sort of jump has probably happened on Mars.\n\nIt is quite possible - though this is speculative - that because the Earth has never had its axis shift a great deal that the climate has always been stable enough for animals and plants. \n\nIn other words, without the Moon, it is quite possible that only algae and other primitive creatures would exist on Earth.5	When is ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption" podcast posted on iTunes each day?

This isn't the first time the dem has tried to put on the floor the subject of the draft.  And for anyone who can put two and two togeher, it's a blanket admission that Clinton didn't know when to quit with the "down-sizing" of the military that Bush senior had started.  The dem.s said we'd never be in another two-front war and that because communist Russia had fallen, that there were no more enemies of the state.  Believe me, Clinton's down sizing was so completely ill conceived and ill advised.  I remember asking Admiral Nader (one of the politically appointed architects) about the reason.  His response was that "the economy is slow."  So, I said, if the economy is slow, that usually means that people aren't working.  If they're not working, they have no money.  No expendable income.  How is taking thousands of gainfully employed people who work for wages well below minimum wage, cutting their jobs and turning them out to an already retarded economy suppose to help?  Won't that be more of a strain?  I was told to sit down and was never really given an answer.  Yep, we'd NEVER fight another two front war.3	when setting eggs in an incbator with automatic turner,which end goes down?  If the incubator has an automatic turner it doesn't matter.

My friend and I were thinking today, (yes it hurt a little) Why is the white ball the dominate ball?  It is the one that hits all the other balls in to the pockets, and why is the black ball last?  We thought the man who made the game was racist.  Only for the simple reason that the white ball seems to dominate the black ball.  the white call hits the black ball in, the whit call hits the strip balls in, the white ball hits the solid color balls in the pockets.... why cant the 8 ball be blue or green?  When does it have to be the white ball hitting the other balls around?  Why cant this change?  I love pool.  However, it just came to me that this is a racist’s game. Do U think it is? Yes of course it's a racists game, BUT NOT THE ACTUAL GAME OR BALL COLORS..Hell I abuse who ever I'm playing to the max, even if it entails being a lil racist ,,,,BUT Hell it's only in fun cos cop the same from opponent, That's life WHO ISN'T RACIST these days HUH?\nBut not game itself,that's being plain stupid to the max...Cheers Bro...1	Does anyone know what city the Russian space program is in?

Simplify the following without using a calculator:\nlog(2(radical2) - 3log(radical3) - 3 \nall over\nlog9 - log 4 + 4\n\nThe answer should be -3/4, but I just can't get that one.\nDoes anyone know how to work that out? Okay, let's see if we can get through this.  I'll use "R" instead of "radical" just to keep it a bit shorter\n\n[log(2R2) - 3log(R3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nStart in the top.  Notice that 2R2 = 2(2^1/2) = 2^3/2 (2 to the 3/2 power).  Likewise, R3 = 3^1/2 (3 to the 1/2 power).  So:\n\n[log(2^3/2) - 3log(3^1/2) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow remember that an exponent within a logarithm moves out to the front.  So:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2) - (3/2)(log 3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow factor out the 3/2 from each of the terms:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow let's go to the denominator.  We'll rewrite the values 9 and 4 as squares, then move the exponents out like we did before.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [log(3^2) - log(2^2) + 4]\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2 log 3 - 2 log 2 + 4]\n\nNow factor 2 out of each term in the denominator.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nOne more little thing to make this work.  We actually need the signs changed in the numerator, so let's factor out a -1 from each term (we should have factored out -3/2 earlier):\n\n[(-3/2)(log 3 - log 2 + 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nNow notice that the top and bottom both have (log 3 - log 2 + 2).  Since this appears on both top and bottom, cancel it out.  This leaves us with:\n\n(-3/2) / 2\n-3/4\n\nI know this was long and drawn out--I hope you followed the steps.7	Have any of you voted on Google Idol?

Eat your veggies and don't do drugs :)2	After a crash diet or fasting, do you gain all the weight back even if you try to eat healthy afterward? Do you gain MORE weight back? Yes, and more.  By crash dieting (using the definition of extreme caloric restrition) you have convinced your body that it needs to store any energy it consumes rather than use it to power the body.  In other words, you have told it to get fat.  \nThat is why eating 6 small meals a day is the best for losing weight.  As an example, if you are a normal healthy adult female you need about 1200 cals a day on average to power your body.  So eat 6 small meals of 200 cals each (good cals, NOT candy bars!) with protien, dairy, fruits and nuts being your focus and you will lose weight (providing you burn 1200 cals!) because your body will see that you have enough food to survive and it does not need to store the energy rather than conserve it.6	Do you look at butts on men?

I have had these guys in my home for over a month now I've tried the foam drain cleaners, the exterminater doesn't know.  I've cleaned under the fridge the drian overflowes EVERYTHING, I've fogged the house yet they're still here.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm sure you're aware that you have to find their breeding site. Once the site is found it must be thoroughly scraped, cleaned, and dried. \n\nThe locations vary widely, but are usually associated with rotting fruit, vegetables or meat, wet organic soil, potted plants, cut flowers, garbage disposals, pet cages and floor drains. \n\nLarge infestations of these flies are often the result of broken drains or garbage disposals that allow organic matter to accumulate in out-of-the-way places such as wall voids, under floors, in basements, or in the soil of crawl spaces. Phorid flies often serve as an indicator of a broken sewage line. As organic-rich waste-water passes through a damaged line, some of the solution seeps into surrounding soil. This can provide the perfect breeding ground for phorid flies. If you have an ongoing phorid fly problem, consider having the sewage lines inspected for leaks and repaired as needed5	a votre avis qui puisse remporte le tour de France cette année? ma tinto A mon avis, sur ce qu'il a montré au Giro, Ivan Basso sera difficile à battre.

Secretaries get more kidney problems because their urethra is shorter than men and when they spend hours holding their urine in their bladder sometimes reflux can occur and cause a kidney infection.

Maybe I am just stereotyping, but should it take a GUY very long to get over a relationship that was nothing but destructive to his own self esteem? He says he hates her now....and still loves her. \n\nHe also slept with me about 2 weeks after they broke up. It has been about 2 weeks since we did that...and we were drunk.\n\nIs this guy just girly with the emotional baggage or do guys really hurt inside and just not show it? I expect to hear this kind of stuff from women, not men. I thought men just moved on, no skin off their back.\n\nI'm not trying to be his girlfriend, but I certainly wouldn't mind starting up some sort of "lover" situation with him.\n\nHow long is it going to take him to move on? They dated for about a year and a half....and the last half was nothing but problems. Yes, it is as normal for a guy to have emotional baggage as it is for a girl.  If he really cared for her, he is probably still dealing with those feelings.  As for his past relationship being in a "destructive," just remember that love is often blind.  He probably didn't see it that way if, in fact, he was truly "in love" with her.  \n\nNow, as for your comment about starting up some sort of a "lover" situation with him, here is my suggestion:  Just go slowly, it may take him a little time to put the last one behind him.  So, be there as a friend...albeit a friend with occasional benefits...and wait for him to come around.  He will eventually, though it may take longer than a few weeks.  Just remember, the quickest way to get over a past lover is to find a new lover.  So, it sounds like you are in the perfect position to achieve what you are hoping to start up.  \n\nBest of luck!5	I've set a goal to run a marathon Oct 8th.

I have lymphedema in both arms, and some days are better than others. Is it aggravated by something I'm eating? Introduction\n\nThere is no special diet that will prevent or control lymphedema; however, good nutrition promotes good health and this helps the body manage with the stresses related to lymphedema. When other conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, are present the diet must be adjusted to accommodate the specialized needs of these conditions.\n\nDietary Protein\n\nSince the fluid associated with lymphedema is protein-rich a question that often arises is, “Should I stop eating protein so there won’t be protein in this fluid?” The answer to this question is, “No! Do not stop eating protein. It won’t solve your problem because proteins are essential nutrients.”\n\nDietary proteins are present in the foods we eat and are important to good health because:\n# Proteins are the building blocks of the body.\n# Proteins are the only nutrients that can repair worn-out tissue and build new ones.\n# Proteins are used by the body in manufacturing hormones.\n# Proteins have a role in building antibodies to fight infections.\n# Proteins aid the blood in transporting oxygen and nutrients.\n# Proteins are essential to the clotting of blood.\n\nWhen There is a Shortage of Dietary Proteins\n\nThe goal for each individual should be to eat the appropriate amount of dietary protein to meet nutritional needs. This protein should come from a variety of sources, not only meat, and include only a minimum of fat.\n\nWhen there are not enough dietary proteins available to meet the daily needs of the body, proteins are taken from the tissues and muscles to maintain the proper protein level of the blood. A severe shortage of dietary proteins will weaken connective tissues and causes them to swell. This is known as hunger edema and it can be seen in the swollen bellies of starving children.\n\nSeriously restricting the intake of dietary protein in an effort to control the swelling of lymphedema does not help. It has just the opposite effect: It increases the amount of swelling that is present. It also weakens the muscles and other tissues.\n\nStaying Hydrated\n\nThe term hydrated describes the state of having adequate fluids in the body. Maintaining this state helps the body remove impurities from the blood and this is important to good health.\n\nDrinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, is essential to maintaining this balance within the body. Cutting back on fluid intake in an effort to reduce the swelling of lymphedema doesn’t work! Instead of the desired effect, the protein-rich lymph of lymphedema attracts more fluid from the other parts of the body. This can cause increased swelling in the affected area.\n\nDrinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day is recommended to maintain good health; however this need increases in hot weather, or in very dry conditions, when the body looses fluids more rapidly.\n\nBeing well hydrated, by drinking plenty of water, is particularly important after an MLD or pump treatment because it is necessary to flush out the impurities that were moved during treatment.\n\nCaffeine, which is a mild diuretic, reduces the level of body fluids by encouraging the kidneys to excrete more urine. For this reason caffeine containing substances (coffee, tea, chocolate and many soft drinks) should be consumed only in moderation.\n\nAlcohol also has a diuretic effect that stimulates the kidneys to excrete more water and thereby increasing dehydration.\n\nEating a Balanced Diet\n\nEating a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended for maintaining good general health. It also aids the body in coping with the added stress caused by lymphedema.\n\nHigh salt foods, which encourage the body to retain fluids, are not part of a recommended healthy diet.\n\nMaintaining Normal Weight\n\nMaintaining the normal weight for your height and age is also an important part of managing lymphedema. The mechanism of how excess fat interacts with the development of lymphedema is not yet clear3	Can you use a strawman and a red herring within the same argument?

If you're of average height for your age, you're not fat. You're probably in very nice shape!\n\nHowever, what other people think or tell you won't change your mental image.  Part of what makes you feel that way is that your body is changing from that of a girl to that of a woman.  You're getting curves in all the right places, and developing a figure.  It's a great thing, but it may take time to get comfortable with getting, like..old, gurl ;-)\n\nIf your weight is becoming an obsession, where you feel that you have to lose weight to look "good", then you should probably talk to an adult about it.  If you don't feel that you can talk to your parents, then maybe an adult friend, a school counselor...  If the feeling continues, it can lead to anorexia, bulimia, and all the complications that result from those - even death.5	Un surf très impressionnant.Qu'en pensez-vous? http://www.dailymotion.com/cluster/extreme/video/xmexy_surf-impressionnant Vidéo trés impressionnante même aprés plusieurs visu.\nIl ne s'agit pas de Laird Hamilton, mais d'un autre (J'ai mangé son nom) Il a surfé cette vague pour une vidéo de la marque Billabong (Billabong Odyssey).

Find the degree measure of the base angles.\n\na, 50 degrees    b, 80 degrees   c, 90 degrees    d,120 degrees\n\nI don't understand how to do this.  I already omitted answer choices C and D because they are base angles, and 90 + 90 would leave no measure for the third angle, and 120+120 is over the sum of the angles in a triangle.  I just need someone to tell me how to do it.  thanks If it is an isosceles triangle, and you drop a height from the angle between the 14's, then you're creating two right triangles with hypotenuse 14 and one leg 9 (the height bisects the base of the triangle).  Using some trig, you can find the base angle.  From the point of view of that angle, 9 is an adjacent side, and 14 is a hypotenuse.  So,\n\ncos x = 9/14\ncos x = 0.6429\nx = 50 (look it up in a table or use your cos^(-1) function on your calculator)\n\nSo your answer is (a).9	why americans decided to vote bush for second term? anyhting other than normal reasoning?but kerry seemed to be fine.so why ? because Bush has moral values.

Not even other people?  It's not that most people don't care about anything.  It's that they only care about themselves.

(what a weird system this is?)\nI cured my non working IE7 by running Internet Options, Advanced, Reset Internet Explorer settings. This clears various add-ons, resets history etc. etc. And now it all works, without affecting the other user, which is me. I re-enabled a few things that I thought this user would need.\nHope this helps anybody in a similar position. You can run this reset through the IE7 Tools drop down too, if your IE7 is working enough to do it. Dont use it as it allows to much rubbish to pass onto my system. Try another Browser. I personally use Opera as it doesnt use Active X controls which allows stuff to run on your PC. Although Yahoo says you have to purchase it. It is still free to download and use. See links below to find out the best one for you. Or you can still stay with your browser. Personally I have never had a problem with Opera thats why it gets my vote I hate having to sort out problems that effect my surfing.4	Website help please?

Go to religon and spirituality section in yahoo answers and read the question marked "this is what 666 really is".1	while boiling water water why water does flow out but milk does?  I agree with Kunche and I'm expanding his explanation that's it. \nMilk is highly viscous fliud. So it will always have a dry film on the top of it due to exposure to atmosphere. This dry film will not allow gases or water vapur which come out when heated to escape out. So like a baloon the milk layer expands and rises high. When you disturb that top layer by sprinkling water or blowing air when it is expanding you will see a lot of gases escaping out as though some work has been alloted to them. That is the proof that gases are trapped inside that layer. But coming to water it has very less viscosity. The particles or molecules will move aside freely to allow the water vapour to escape out. That's why there will not be any rise in the layer. That's the very reason why you see more vapuors coming out of water compared to milk.\nLol dan. That's really good one. I couldn't help laughing out in my cabin here. But let the kids learn. Don't discourage them.

I find my personality most like my Grandfather, the man was a nuerosurgeon, so for him, science was his profession.  He was prestbytarian and married a Catholic in a ceremony off to the side since he wasn't Catholic, although this I don't believe.\n\nHe would tell jokes, and when smoking his pipe would ask questions about the nature of the universe.\n\nWe would sit on his knee and he would make letters in our backs. He praised us for being right.\n\nHe smiled and hugged.\n\nThe church, a Catholic Church, wasn't big enough for all the people who gathered for his funeral and there was a standing crowd.\n\nI don't think I will have that, since Im only some dope in payroll, as opposed to a man who saved peoples lives after an accident.\n\nThis was for me love.  I suppose I emulate this by smiling and asking my "questions" to the world. \n\nI wish I could do it better and not be "contreversial", but if I asked fluff questions, would Jim_darwin be the Jim_darwin you would want to answer For me it was my grandmother.  She was 76 when I was born and almost 87 when she died.  She had Alzheimer's, although in 1975 they did not use that term - it was just 'senile' then, and had to live the last four years of her life with constant care in a nursing home.  I visited her three times a week and even though she didn't have her mind I think she always knew who I was because even though she didn't verbalize at that point she always got upset when my father (her son) visited without me (he stopped every day on his way into work).\n\nWhen I visited my grandmother I noticed the many other men and women in the home who did not have anyone visiting them.  Being the young child I was I started visiting them too so that when I went I had my 'rounds' to make.\n\nIt caused a lot of happiness in these people to be remembered even if it was only by a small child who was not biologically connected to them in any way.  It taught me a lesson in love that to this day I will never forget.  It also taught me that every human life has value and should never be forgotten.\n\nI am thankful for the lesson that that experience has taught me.9	ethnicity and political salience in northern region of ghana?

A variant of the wound field DC motor is the universal motor. The name derives from the fact that it may use AC or DC supply current, although in practice they are nearly always used with AC supplies. The principle is that in a wound field DC motor the current in both the field and the armature (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) at the same time, and hence the mechanical force generated is always in the same direction. In practice, the motor must be specially designed to cope with the AC current (impedance must be taken into account, as must the pulsating force), and the resultant motor is generally less efficient than an equivalent pure DC motor. Operating at normal power line frequencies, the maximum output of universal motors is limited and motors exceeding one kilowatt are rare. But universal motors also form the basis of the traditional railway traction motor. In this application, to keep their electrical efficiency high, they were operated from very low frequency AC supplies, with 25 Hz and 16 2/3 hertz operation being common. Because they are universal motors, locomotives using this design were also commonly capable of operating from a third rail powered by DC.\n\nThe advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have the typical characteristics of DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. As a result such motors are usually used in AC devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently. Continuous speed control of a universal motor running on AC is very easily accomplished using a thyristor circuit, while stepped speed control can be accomplished using multiple taps on the field coil. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave DC with 0.707 of the RMS voltage of the AC power line).\n\nUnlike AC motors, universal motors can easily exceed one revolution per cycle of the mains current. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high-speed operation is desired. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors will exceed 10,000 RPM, Dremel and other similar miniature grinders will often exceed 30,000 RPM. A theoretical universal motor allowed to operate with no mechanical load will overspeed, which may damage it. In real life, though, various bearing frictions, armature "windage", and the load of any integrated cooling fan all act to prevent overspeed.\n\nWith the very low cost of semiconductor rectifiers, some applications that would have previously used a universal motor now use a pure DC motor, usually with a permanent magnet field. This is especially true if the semiconductor circuit is also used for variable-speed control.\n\nThe advantages of the universal motor and alternating-current distribution made installation of a low-frequency traction current distribution system economical for some railway installations. At low enough frequencies, the motor performance is approximately the same as if the motor were operating on DC. Frequencies as low as 162/3 hertz were employed.8	how do i get my husband to come live with me in america, i am a permanent resident{green card holder}? pl i need all the helpi can get.i lived in the usa for 6yrs, i will also need to know how long it will take, cant afford a lawyer. thanks just ask him thought you were husband and wife ??0	Translation of "Unser Kind wird durch Therapien unterstützt"?

More new immigrants, hopefully legally trough a comprehensive Guest Worker Program, or if that doesn't materialize, illegal immigrants.\n\nPS: Your assumption is incorrect, they will never raise the pay, they are used to those levels of pay.

Are you talking personal medical problems, or the ones asked in Yahoo answers?  Obviously, you can take yourself out of the yahoo link if these are the medical problems you are asking about.\n\nI pressume the problems actually are yours personally, or belong to a friend or family member....correct?  The answer is you have to deal with life good and bad, because the alternative is death.  Waking up each day is the first hurdle for everyone.  After waking up, we have a whole day of opportunies, some we make for ourselves and some life will hand to us whether we want them or not.  The opportunity may seem and act like a whammy, but we still have to get through it/them the best we can, go to sleep, wake up and start a new day.  Like I said, the other choice is death and for most of us, this is a definate,  unacceptable choice....at least for today.  Sometimes the best we can do is take one day at a time, or one hour at a time, or one moment at a time, get through it and face the next.1	on gravity..? maybe I should have learned this in 3rd grade but here is my question...#1 is everything in the universe held it its specific locations by gravity? if so why do stars  "fall" and not float? #2 will gravitys "lock" on everything eventually weaken or will it remain constant forever?is the reason we can walk on the earth and not the moon because of the shield of the atmosphere? if so will the atmosphere eventually waste away? #1) Everything in the universe is affected by gravity but is not held in specific locations. Objects are in motion but under the effects of gravity.\n\n#2) Gravity is a constant with a few rules to follow: the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to their mass but inversely proportional to their distance from each other. This means that object with more mass have more gravitational force but the gravity that they generate is lessened as two object move farther apart from each other.\n\nScientists speculate whether the universe will eventually succumb to the forces of gravity, causing all matter to eventually be pulled back into where the Big Bang originated, or if the Bang was sufficiently powerful, will all of the matter in the celestial bodies in the universe continue moving outward until the distance between the stars is so great that gravity can't overcome it and each galaxy is left to slowly burn out like sparks from a fireworks display?\n\nFor the last part of your question, people can walk on the Earth and on the Moon. The gravitational pull of our moon is a fraction of the Earth's pull because the moon is a fraction of the Earth's mass (remember the rules in part 1). We can't breathe on the moon because there isn't an atmosphere. The lack of an atmosphere has nothing to do with the moon's size though. It's simply due to the way the moon was formed.\n\nI hope that I was able to explain this to you properly. I'm no scientist.7	Who else is glad Jade did not make it into the final 2?

One thing that was very strange was, for about 2 wks after my reflux operation "no sore throat" than one day it started and has remained with me!  The only time the pain is gone is for about an hour after l eat..then the pain returns Very odd.  I'd seek another opinion.\n\nGo to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.4	Picture problems on computer? when i use a online japanese translator only two small boxes appear it won't show up on my computer for some reason can you please help me by telling me how to fix it The problem is that your browser doesn't support UNICODE characters, say, the page is in a language that the browser doesn't support, so, each letter that it doesn't recognize it'll show them as a small box.\n\nTry with a different browser or upgrade your current one.3	Do jobs accept online degrees?  Any degrees offered through accredited institutions of higher education are likely to be accepted as valid. There are standards that each school must meet to be accredited and employers look for this when choosing whether to hire someone based on the degrees they have. Degrees obtained from schools which are not accredited whether online or not are not likely to be accepted by employers. If you are looking into pursuing a degree online make sure you check out what kind of accreditations the school has. I have included a two good sources to reference in choosing schools that offer online degrees. Check them out.\n\nAlso if an employer isn't willing to accept your degree provide him with the schools accreditation. He may be afraid to take a risk but if he sees that the school is legit and accredited he too will be more likely to take that risk and to accept your degree as valid.0	What's the best present a girl can give to a guy whose birthday falls on Valentine's Day?

Kevin had five rectangular photographs. The ten side lengths of the photographs were 1cm,. 2cm, 3cm... 10cm (with each occuring once).\n\nKatie has five rectangular photographs with side lengths 1cm., 2cfm, 3cm... 10cm (with each occuring once). She assembled hers into a rectangular frame of size 15cm * 10cm. Find the side lengths of each photobgraph and show how the photographs can be put in teh frame. Let us assume that each photograph is rectangular. The photographs must have different length of sides, which are in the range 1 through 10. Also, the sides of the photographs must be such that the sum of the area of all of them equals 150 cm^2. Further, the sides should be such that these 5 photographs can be arranged in a 15 cm * 10 cm frame. If the dimensions of the n-th photograph be ‘an’ and ‘bn’ then\n\na1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3 + a4*b4 + a5*b5 = 150 _________(1).\n\nBy trial we find\n10*1 + 9*8 + 7*6 + 5*4 + 3*2 = 10 + 72 + 42 + 20 + 6 = 150.\n\nWe also find that these dimensions can be arranged in a rectangle of dimensions 15*10 as shown in the fig. that you I have sent you by email.\n\nThe form 10*1 implies a rectangle which has its 10 unit long side parallel to the X-axis and 1 unit long side parallel to the Y-axis.\n\nHowever, not all the combinations satisfying equation (1) can be arranged in the aforesaid frame. Let us take the combination [1*8, 2*7, 3*6, 4*5, 9*10]. The sum of these 5 terms is 150 but these 5 rectangles cannot be arranged in a 15*10 frame.1	london and australia??? did you no there are more people living in the city of london than there is in the hole of australia???? amazing eh? concidering that australia isint far off the same size as usa That is cool.

He new I used to like him and he would always flirt with me alot. He started going out with this girl but it only lasted two days. He then went with this other girl but it only lasted a week or two. He is now single and I think I like him again. What should I do go with him or not?????? The fact that you mostly see him at work, that is a great opportunity for you. Please don't be too forward with him - like asking him out on a date or telling him straight that you like him. He could be one of the guys that find it a turn-off. Instead try to show more interest in what he does at work, ask him "neutral" questions like: "What challenges are you currently facing here at work?", "What are your future dreams?" After about a month of chatting with him, start buying him lunch (but not too much) maybe once in two weeks, and say "I like this dish so much, I just thought of sharing with you."

The Earth is speeding at such a rate not felt by us (minute earthlings) on the surface. The wobble is caused by the fact that the earths rotation is still trying to balance out from it's original creation. Due to the fact that the Earths' mantle is still constantly moving under intense pressure, and made up of molten rock, the weight of the world is not level.

The spring is initially stretched by 0.100 m, and the object is released from rest there.  It proceeds to move without friction. The next time the speed of the object is zero is 0.500 s later.  What is the maximum speed of the object Okay, this is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM).If the velocity is zero after 0.5s, this means the period of oscillation (T) is 2x0.5s = 1.0sec. If the initial displacement is 0.1m, then the amplitude of oscillation (A) is 2x0.1m = 0.2m. The maximum speed of the object will be achieved when the displacement is 0. The equation for the displacement for SHM is:\n\ny = Asin(2pift + pi/2) where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency = 1/T and disp = initial displacement, and t = time.\n\nSo the velocity is given by the time derivative of displacement:\n\nv = Acos(2pift + pi/2) = 0.2cos(2pit + pi/2)\n\nNow, since the maximum velocity is achieved after 0.25s (the max velocity is when the object passes through the origin which will be after half the time taken to reach the other end of the cycle);\n\nv = 0.2cos(pi/2 + pi/2) = 0.2cos pi = -0.2m/s\n\nqed4	do any of you know nas wep site please a need directions?  www.maps.google.com7	i need some advice from a nerd? who is the guy in x-men when he touches the cards and throws them they explode.

How do you define it? and how much harder is it than just taking a single. I did a Double Honours degree; you do the 'core' of two majors, rather than a major and a minor. Thid adds up to more time and longer essays than a major and minor, and takes quite a lot of self control (because you will have a favourite, but must remember that both are equally important and you need to spend equal time on both). \n\nMany people assume it is just a case of being a fast worker and having the correct 'academic' ability, but I would add time management and self-control/discipline to this. You have to be able to prioritise for yourself- if you have a major/minor at Uni, this is decided for you, but with a double hons it is down to your own willpower.7	Does anyone know the song that plays on that one video game commercial?

The term "social contract" is metaphorical.  It does not refer to an actual piece of paper which specific parties signed and dated, which can be taken to court and enforced.  A legal contract is all that, for the most part.  It is possible to enforce an oral contract in law, but it is done by analogy to a written contract.  A social contract, in contrast, is not analogous.  It is a way to describe the idea of a committment between government and citizens, or between one group of people and another.  It is a metaphor only, and a judge has no jurisdiction over its enforcement.8	What should i do? basically i met this girl and I know I love her and i just want to know how to push the relationship further, i don't think i should tell her i love her just yet as i don't want to risk scaring her off, so what would be the best way to go to the next level ( bit of a cliche!). Dean, to help move this relationship along, as someone has pointed out, just take one step at a time.  You will have to determine, before you proceed, if she "digs" you.  She doesn't necessary have to have the "love" feeling for you yet but she should like you enough to help work the relationship into the "love" stage.\n\nOne way to find out is to communicate with her on a regular basis.  Do you guys have anything in common that will make a first date?  Is there an interest in something that you can share to bring you two to learn about the other - to see if there is a "fit" so to speak?\n\nOnce you've determined that you are both on the same path (don't assume - find out; if she likes you, she won't keep it a secret), you can start dating her.  You should definitely hold onto telling her you love her until you feel it is right.  You will know when the moment is right because you will know that she feels the same way or is close to it.  \n\nSo, find out more about her, her likes, her dislikes and find a way to see if her behavior dictates that she has a fancy for you.  Then you can go to the next level: dating her.  \n\nRemember, take your time and don't "push" it.  If she likes you, you'll know sooner or later and you won't have wonder what to do next.\n\nGood luck!4	Since I downloaded ie7 I get an error about referenced memory how can I correct this?

Recently we had to decide whether to buy a new product at the expense of some products which have overlapping functions. The new product offered better features and wider functions at a higher cost, and most customers like it. Because of that, we bought it. Some colleagues were not happy as they have less on their plate as a result. I think we made a good decision because it's based on what customer needs, rather than what the staff think. Sometimes we can easily put our own interests first. I agree.  I work in manufacturing and I hate seeing the way customers are treated. My employer believes that "Customers are our Priority" is a good slogan to put in our mission statement.\nIf they were honest they would say "Please the Stockholders, Screw the Customers"\nI worked in retail before this job and I was trained in the old school.

Infrared energy is often used to treat muscle injury, heat it generates stimulates blood flow, which speeds the healing process. \n\nHelps study the region of the Milky Way galaxy obscured by dust clouds. It is also helpful for Artificial satellites in orbit. \n\nSpecial photographic plates and electronic detectors absorb different infrared wavelengths to produce satellite images. This technique, known as remote-sensing imagery in GIS.It can also be used for monitoring plant growth, detecting diseased crops, and measuring heat generated by particular types of industries. Night observations using infrared wavelengths also yield a surprisingly detailed record of natural and human activities.1	What makes glass keep popping and snapping after it's been broken?

I could view your profile correctly...nothing of the nature that your described happened!2	What are the causes,types and treatments of psychophysiological diseases?  Depends on who you talk to. Conventional medicine would disagree with me but  as a practising naturopath I come from the premise that all disease state are as a result from poor mental/emotional patterning and or energy (chi) blockages. These make you susceptable to infection due to imbalance or if you like predispose you to infection. We breathe in and out and carry millions of pathogens each moment of each day, why then do we become sick all of a sudden from a pathogen we have carried for years? The energetic conditions were right. Thoughts influence us at every level including physical, for instance depressed people look depressed, rounded shoulders, poor digestion, lowered immunity etc and they think depressed thoughts, profoundly negative. Tibetan monks for instance are said to be the happiest people on the planet and think very happy thoughts, they frequently live till ages far and beyond western people with little or no ill health.\nThe treatments numbers are far ranging and their effectiveness is varying. Most natural therapies are approached from the premise of healthy mind/emotions/spirit=healthy body so any of those modalities are considered treatments, examples would include reiki, reflexology, massage, counselling, herbalism, Accupuncture and many, many more.\nThis is a topic that there is a great deal of literature available on and you can do Diploma courses on them. Puch in your question to google and sit back for about the next 50 years and go for it.\nAs a foot note the vast majority of my clients are patients that western or convetional medicine has failed for one reason or another, they end up on my door step and in  the majority of cases the approach I use brings lasting positive results, world wide there is a massive swing to natural health and healing therapies, ask yourself why.\nHope this helps you.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.2	Which is better?

How does length affect a strings sound? Strings have sound because they vibrate in harmonic waves.  The length of those waves, or "wavelengths" is one factor that affects how the sound will behave.\n\nSince both ends of the string are fixed tight, the waves are forced to begin and end in a definite space.  This forces the wavelengths into lengths that are dependant on one wave starting and finishing from one end of the string to the other.  Since different string lengths will produce different wavelengths, the sound will behave differently.  \n\nThe other main factor that affects sound is tension.  The tighter the string, the shorter the wave will be.  A short wave height, or "amplitude" causes the wave to move faster, which produces a higher pitch.\n\nSo, you have wavelength and amplitude.  Those two things could take up a whole semester of physics, but they're relatively simple concepts.  (Unless you play trumpet)4	Is there a affiliate(internet) for cards to join for free?

My PT job brings me about $4,000.00 a year, only 4 thousand, no typo. And because he never wanted me to work more than that, I think I would be entitled to spousal support. His job and income always provided for me, now because of his lying and cheating, I'm walking out on ten years of marriage. Am i elligable for alimony according to IL law?"\n\nThe quick answer to your question is "Probably."\n\nThe basic purpose of maintenance is to allow spouses who were supported during the marriage-- but who are unable to support themselves after dissolution of the marriage-- to be able to have time to establish a fair degree of independence.  Consequently, maintenance payments for a year or two-- depending on the particular circumstances of the case-- might be warranted where the previously supported spouse is actively pursuing employment, job training or advanced education, where the other spouse has the financial means to provide such support,  and where the division of assets has not created a financial situation that provides a means of support already.\n\nFor example, if a previously supported spouse gets custody of children and is consequently awarded possession of the marital residence until the children reach the age of majority (when the house will be sold and the proceeds divided between the ex-spouses), then the other spouse's support of the residence might negate the need for maintenance payments.  Also, any large lump sum distributions of funds might do the same.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that Marital Settlement Agreements often include a waiver of maintenance-- and other provisions that severe ties as much as possible.  You do want to get DIVORCED, right?  The attorney fees, court costs and general headaches of trying to get paid maintenance sometimes outweigh the benefits of getting it.\n\n[This is not legal advice.

I've attended many MLB games in many various ballparks and I'll say that San Francisco Giants' AT&T Park, SBC Park, or Pacific Bell Park is far the best. The view of the bay is unbeatable, the atmosphere there makes me want to never leave the ballpark. I've been to the Yankee Stadium and its a ok-ok stadium, never really liked it.

Greetings from inside the Yahoo Brain in New York City!\nHope you're catching the live webcast at: http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/asktheplanet/brain.html !\n\nNicest park I've attended is Orioles Park at Camden Yards.  Just beautiful.  That complex also houses the best NFL football stadium as well, M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nBut the BEST park is by far Yankee Stadium.  If you walk into a game there, fully packed with 50,000 fans (as most are), you can't help but get goosebumps as you almost feel the electricity and history.  It's great.\n\nConversely Shea Stadium, in which I've watched dozens and dozens of games, is a total DUMP, and the worst park in the major leagues, as constantly voted by players and fans alike.  Thankfully the Mets and their loyal fans are going to be rewarded with a new stadium soon.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--J.4	why all the time i receive email saying i won something for free but it be a buy something 1st catch.? every =day i get these email saying im the winner. then i click on the site out of excitement but it be i catch. when will i when something for real. like the florida lottery.lol It is called spam and it just goes along with having an email address.

The easiest and most effective way to judge the fit of a mountain bike it by checking "stand-over clearance", which is the amount of space between your crotch and the top tube of the bike when you stand over it.\n\nGenerally speaking, stand-over clearance should be between 1" and 3" on a mountain bike.\n\nHOW TO TEST:\n1) Stand over the top tube of the bike with your legs shoulder width apart\n2) Now, lift the bike (front and back) until your crotch is resting on the top tube.  You can do this by grabbing hold of the top tube with one hand in front of your body and the other in back.\n3) Finally, check stand-over clearance by looking at the space between your tires and the ground (you are still lifting the bike, right?).  Again, this should be between 1" to 3" for a mountain bike.  \n\nThis assumes you have the bike in-hand and physically with you to perform this test.

It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.\n\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.\n\nAs far as making economic condition as criteria is concerned, there is always good and bad of all thoughts. Good about this will be that this should be the correct way of deciding giving help however there are too many lacuna in this as getting certificate for economic background is very easy to get since no one file income tax return and there no proof of incomes for people other than salaried people so what will happen ultimately is again people who do not deserve the benefit will get it and needy will remain eluded with this.\nI agree that when it comes to job then what we need is competent people in jobs to provide proper service and let our country grow. It is wrong to say the people who need help to rise first time are not competent but what is required is that we bring them up and educate and train them so that they are competent enough to take up the challenges. Now if we talk about getting a doctor without enough skills. This is often repeated example but what we fail to understand that a person cannot be a doctor just by getting admission in medical college. S/he became doctor after passing out from the college. If we say that college examination system is such that they will pass person without knowledge then problem does not lie in reservation in admission but in examination system which required to be looked into. Having said that if education system is not good and it will allow person without skill to get the degree then what is guarantee that a person who has come by other route let us by paying higher fees or something and for that matter what is guarantee that a person who have scored 90+ marks is good in medical study. So then we are running risk of many doctors without skills operating on us. So this argument that if the person has come with reservation will be not competent doctor is not correct. If a person has passed MBBS (s/he can be anyone reserve one or other) and do not know how to use scalpel and then we should hung all the teachers who have taught them, people who have set the papers and all the examiners who has taken their practical exams and checker who checked their examination papers.\n\nSo mantra for anything to be good and successful is honest implementation of the same.2	Does society except big women now rather then a couple of years ago?

I read your question "What would happen if I shot someone with an antimatter bullet?"  It is right in that matter and antimatter annihilate each other on contact, and are in fact drawn magnetically to each other to mutual detonation.  If in fact the particles could last so long as to leave the gun fly through the air without detonation (we may assume some sort of magnetic container) the bullet becomes a small antimatter missile, or bomb, with a few grams, maybe ounces of antimatter.  When such a payload of antimatter explodes there is a large gamma radiation burst, one pound of which would be more powerful than the first atomic bombs, detonated over Japan at the end of WWII.   The conclusion i draw is there would be a massive explosion that would devastate an area the size of a small city, from a single antimatter bullet.

The Bible says thou shall not kill, so why did the christian church take it upon themselves once they had became linked with the Crown & Govenment to erradicate all earlier beliefs?  They called the gods of the nature religions devils & demons and accused there followers of laying curses & practising foul magic then hunted these poor people down, arrested them, sacrificed them, executed them, then brang in special laws to cover their crimes.  Incentives in terms of land & money of those convicted were provided to encourage people to report their neighbours and fellow villagers.   Can you really say that this is a GOOD religion to be apart of??? ALL religion is evil, The major "ultimate truths" all have the END OF THE WORLD as their stated and sought after goal.

Marijuana is an extremely useful plant that should be cultivated legally. The drug aspect of it should be decriminalized and treated as cigarettes and  alcohol are, with age limits and extreme taxation. We could pull this country half way out of debt simply by taxing the marijuana market. The effects of the drug are no more imparing than that of alcohol and the idea that this is a gateway to harsher drugs is ridiculous. If it were as legal as alcohol and cigarettes, it would be no more a "gateway" to smoking or injesting illegal things than they are also. Our tax dollars are better spent enforcing and punishing violent crimes and not looking for a college kids smoking a joint.5	Weaknesses of my martial art.? I'm a novice at Japanese Ju Jitsu. I would like to know where the weaknesses in the art lie as it seems a bit of an all round art. We learn strikes, locks, throws and ground fighting. Higher belts in our particula style (Seishin Mizu Ryu) learn kinves, bottles, staffs and swords. Wondering  where it's main weaknesses are. Jujitsu is a good art, however it takes a LOT of practice to become fluent in it. There are all kinds of stories out there of people who have used jujitsu effectively in real situations, but in order to overcome the fear involved in a real situation you will need to have practiced the technique hundreds of times, such that it comes subconsciously.0	Where did the oath of celibacy(withstanding from sex) come from in Priesthood and Nunhood? And Why? I'm not catholic, but I do read the bible and go to a non-denominational church. But, in reading the bible,I don't read of God asking man to commit to celibacy if they choose to be a leader of his flock.  I feel that humans just make life harder on themselves by envoking unnatural laws for themselves to follow, when God only asks us to love and serve him, etc.. Humans were made sexual beings and that's probably why the priests are sleeping with altar boys, nuns, members of the congregation, etc, because physically and mentally we're meant to be with someone in that special way, not alone.  I'm sure that the priests and nuns probably favor themselves manually, in private, to help with all of that pent up sexual frustration and tension.  I respect them to the highest, but just don't buy in to the notion that one must not have sex with a (wife or husband) to lead a God's people. Just as long as they're not sleeping around and it's a wife or husband, done in holy matrimony. That's my view. Catholism has a lot of mixture, therefore many of the traditions, rites and sacraments, are not to be found in the Bible, or in the ancient Christian doctrine even Paul mention it on 1st Timothy 4:1-3 1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;  2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;  3  Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.  Hislop says that when the cult to Cibeles an acient babylon godess was established in Pagan Rome, it was established in its primitive form, with a celibate priesthood!!! *The two Babylons Alexander Hislop).\n\nSo my friend Celibacy is not a CHRISTIAN doctrine it has it's origin in pagan cults, and was introduced to the catholic church, and also fathom this How did the Apostle Peter alledglly the first Pope, had a mother in law??????  Even their first pope wasn't celibate right!!2	post natal depression and normal depression? if you have had depression before in your life and get pregnant, is there a possiblity of you getting post natal depression. what are the chances? anyone go through this and found out. thanx Having depression before does not necessarily mean that you will have post partum depression. You can have a baby, and avoid the baby blues or depression, even if you have had depression before. Typical depression can be brought on by many different things (loss, stressful situations, illness, exhaustion, chemical imbalances, etc.) Postnatal Depression is thought to be brought on by an imbalance of hormones.\n\nDr. Claire Weekes has written alot on the subject of anxiety and depression. Her books have helped many learn about the causes behind anxiety and depression, and help many overcome the most debilatating symptoms of anxiety and depression to live normal lives. The greatest thing about her books is that she is very reassuring, and the knowledge that she shares with the reader is empowering. I highly recommend her book "Hope and Help for your Nerves." It really helped me to understand the source of where my anxiety/depression came from. Also highly recommended is "Complete Self Help For Your Nerves." (See URL below.)\n\nBe sure you are getting alot of rest. Sleep deprivation can make you feel out of sorts. Eat a healthy diet and be sure an include some physical activity that your doctor will approve of (I enjoyed water aerobics.) Be sure and have people available to you to help you out with things when your tired, or to talk with when you need to vent. And speak with your ob-gyn about your concerns. I am sure they will have some advice that will help you feel less anxious and put your mind at ease.\n\nGood Luck, and enjoy the arrival of your new little one! :)9	what is the maximum sentence violation of 12025(b)(6), 12031(a)(2)(f)  and 12021(a)(1)? These are gun charges, I have a prior so i am wondering what the enhancements are and am I most likely going to prison? The 12025 charge is punishable by a minimum of 16 months in prison.\n\n12031 is the same.\n\n12021 is the same as well.\n\nAnd I should say it's possible the minimums for all of these might be more than 16 months; I didn't sweat it too much because of what I wrote below.\n\nCan't really discuss the maximums with you without knowing what your prior is for (some of those charges are priorable, and some are not), whether or not you are on probation or parole, what county you are in (some counties are more liberal on these charges than others), and what your Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) might say when it's done.  \n\nDepending on those things, prison is certainly a possibility.

There is a possibility that I will be sued over an appraisal that was performed 2-and-a-half years ago?  I am an appraiser in Indiana and have never experienced this dilemna. It depends on what they sue your for.  Presumably, they are claiming your appraisal was no good and they suffered loss as a result.  If they say you breached a representation in a contract, it arguably could fall under the rules for contracts, which vary.  If it is fraud, it is 6 years from the alleged fraud.  For negligence, it is 2 years from the discovery of the negligence.  Personally, my money is on the negligence, since they'll likely claim you failed to perform your appraisal consistently with your professional duty. Your insurance should cover it, and you should read your policy about your duty to notify them of possible claims.8	is me and elina going to get together soon?

I was dating this guy... and i was really serrious we talked about marriage and everythinmg.... but all of my friends are guys! and i hung out with them alot... and my boyfriend got really jealous all the time. and we finally split up bc of his jealous over my guy friends..... is there something wrong with a girl hanging out with a guys if they are no more then just friends I don't think there is anything wrong with guy friends.  But, you must always be respectful of your relationship.  Put yourself in his place would you be bothered if he were doing what you do.  If so then it probably is not right.  I am not a jealous person but I would not want my boyfriend spending time with girl friends without me.  I would not spend time with guy friends without him.  Our friends have become mutual friends.  If they are only "friends" then an appropriate relationship with them should not be a problem.

The song is famous for John Bonham's immensely powerful drumming, John Paul Jones's galloping bass line (played on a custom made eight string bass), Jimmy Page's overdubbed orchestral guitar arrangement (incredibly the dozen or so guitar tracks on this song were recorded in one session), and a dramatic, epic guitar solo which is considered by many to be among Page's best.\n\nPage has been quoted saying that it is his favorite Led Zeppelin song, so that should go a long way\n\ni guess my personal favorite is No Quarter or How Many More Times0	You know the christian martyrs..? when they were being killed did it hurt them..?? ....? I mean if "God"  were true..does it say some where in the Bible or something about if martyrs will feel any pain..or something like that..?\n\nI'm just wondering..I'm an atheist & I don't want to be a crisitian..i'm just curious.... Peter, as well as some of the other disciples, were crucified. No death could be more painful. Mark was tied between 4 horses and pulled in 4 pieces(or at least that's what some historians say). That's got to hurt a little. Polycarp was burned at the stake. Paul was beheaded not to mention that he was scourged 5 times, beaten with rods 4 times, stoned and many other persecutions while he was alive. The early disciples were persecuted their whole lives and then martyred in the most cruel way. That's why I believe the bible. These men were eyewitnesses of everything they wrote about in the bible and they lived a persecuted life and died horribly and went to their death saying that everything they had said was true when they could have lived a peaceful life and died peacefully if they would just have renounced everything they wrote about. But they didn't. They went to their death saying it was true.8	I hurt my mothers feelings..but i dont feel bad at all?

Insanely difficult motorsport events are becoming more popular all the time - here's a new one which is being described as "the Paris-Dakar of India". The Great Arc event has been devised by Sevenoaks-based company ROARR, which also runs the Jewel of India and the Himalaya Classic Rally.\n\nThe new event pays homage to William Lambton and Sir George Everest, the two leaders of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. The Survey was begun by Lambton and took decades to complete; Lambton died long before the end of the process and was succeeded by his assistant Everest, after whom the world's highest mountain was subsequently named.\n\nThe Great Arc Rally will follow their route from the southern tip of the subcontinent to Hathiopaon in the north, where Everest spent many years calculating the results of the survey. The sting in the tail is that competitors in two of the classes - for 4x4s and motorbikes - will have to go in as straight a line as possible up the spine of India. That means creating river crossings and beating a path through jungles, among other adventures.\n\nCompetitors in the third class, for classic vehicles (anything built before 1975), will be given a less stressful route, sticking to roads and tracks at all times.\n\nThe event will start in October 2007 and last for 21 days. Entry fees are £14,850 for a car and two drivers or £7425 for a bike and rider. Food, accommodation, route guidance, telemetry, medical services and mechanical backup are all included in the fee. If you want to enter the 4x4 class but don't want to bring a vehicle with you, ROARR will hire you a local jeep.2	how can i make ''it'' bigger without buying anything?

Generally, you'll be put on probation for a period of time, required to attend substance abuse education classes and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, submit to random drug testing, attend school full-time or be employed full-time, report to your probation officer on a regular basis, and obey any other directives by the court or your probation officer. Successful completion of this probation will usually result in your record being cleared of the charges brought against you. Failure will probably get you sent to prison.1	Simple Harmonic Motion? I'm having a bit of an issue figuring out what the time and the phase constant would be for this homework problem below for the first part:\n\nA particle moves in simple harmonic motion with a frequency of 2.50 oscillations/s and an amplitude of 5.00 cm.\n(a) Through what total distance does the particle move during one cycle of its motion in cm ?\n(b) What is its maximum speed in cm/s?\n(c) What is the maximum acceleration in m/s^2?\n\nI don't actually need the answers figured out.  I'm thinking that I just take the derivative of the equation for part A for part B (the velocity) and then the second derivative for the acceleration... But like I said, I'm completely clueless about what I would plug in for time and the phase constant.  This is the equation I'm using btw:\n\nx = A cos(angular acceleration * time + phase constant)\n\nI figured 2.50 = 1/T, T=.4\nangular acceeration = 2pi/T = 15.71\n\nAny ideas? You have a problem with your formula. In fact, you should write:\n\nx = A cos(angular speed * t)\nThe phase angle is not relevant to this problem. You are only concerned about complete cycles of the harmonic motion and there is no other particle or timing reference, so the question of phase shift doesn't arise.\n\nThe number to use for "angular speed" is derived from the statement that the particle makes 2.5 oscillations/s. One oscillation corresponds to 2*pi of angular motion and takes 0.4 seconds. Therefore you know that every 0.4 seconds, (angular speed)*0.4*n = n*2*pi. So (angular speed) = 2.5*2*pi. Angular speed calculated like this will have units of radians/s. You calculated the right value, 15.71, but you didn't have the right understanding.\n\nNow you can answer the questions. The first falls out directly from getting the right equation for x. And you are correct that the second and third parts are answered by successive differentiations of x, then finding the maximum. So the amplitude for displacement is A; the amplitude for velocity is A*(angular speed); for acceleration it is A*(angular speed)^2.\nSo: a: 20 cm (particle moves from +5 to -5 to +5)\nb: 78.54 cm/s\nc: 1234 cm/s^2 = 12.34 m/s^22	anyone feel they have an undiagnosed case of multple personality disorder?

I think it is high in saturated fat, and is not healthy. Try virgin olive oil, that is supposed to have the nutrience and fat that is healthy for the body.\n\nThis website feels coconut oil is best used for cooking:\nAnytime you cook a food you run the risk of creating heat-induced damage. Well, suppose there was a type of oil that is stable enough to resist heat-induced damage and so beneficial that it helps you lose weight, promotes heart health and helps to maintain normal cholesterol levels. Would you choose to use this oil?\n\nIf you said yes then you will want to get some coconut oil today. Naturally, when choosing an oil to cook with you want an oil that will not be damaged by high cooking temperatures. Of all the available oils, in my opinion, coconut oil is the oil of choice for cooking because it is nearly a completely saturated fat, which means it is much less susceptible to damage when it is heated. \n\nhttp://www.mercola.com/2003/oct/15/cooking_oil.htm0	If heaven exits and you were to die today what would you say to god?

A raster graphics image, digital image, or bitmap, is a data file or structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, on a computer monitor, paper, or other display device. The color of each pixel is individually defined; images in the RGB color space, for instance, often consist of colored pixels defined by three bytes—one byte each for red, green and blue. Less colorful images require less information per pixel;\n\nan image with only black and white pixels requires only a single bit for each pixel. Raster graphics are distinguished from vector graphics in that vector graphics represent an image through the use of geometric objects such as curves and polygons.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap2	Is it possible to sprain your penis?

Can it be just part of something even bigger? Stephen Hawking said the universe is shaped like a pear with the singularity or big bang at the bottom and the curves in space time. However their is also the fecund universe theory. This states that when one universe has a black hole, time does not end inside a black hole but initiates a quantum bounce. This creates a singularity on the other side creating a baby universe. Each new universe the laws of physics are the same but their may be slight variations. The beliefe of our universe being the way it is, is because ours is how universes typicaly develope. This is basicaly the anthropic principle, which states, if our universe was not the way it was we would not be here. Richard Feynman states that a particle will take every single path through space time available. Meaning each universe could be another possible outcome of reality. A final note on one of the particles that exist in the universe (or perhaps multiverses) is the electron. All electrons are the same one curve. Also electrons move backwards in time while positrons move forward. So the electron is a curve on a atomic scale that moves backwards in time. This is all highly theoretical.

I went to OSU, and every time I say that to someone not from Oregon, they say "is that the Beavers or the Ducks?"  I even heard the guy on Sportcenter get it wrong three days ago.  Are we really that insignificant or what?  \n\nSide question:  How many people do you think will respond to this by calling me an idiot or asking some form of the question: "who cares?" Friend I feel your pain.  See Ducks are dirty smelly bud smoking hippies.  While Beavers hit the sauce a little too hard at times...ok a lot.  Truth be told until one of us (probably the beavers) becomes a dynasty no one will ever know the difference.  I mean really though when it comes to mascots with the exception of Florida and Arizona does anyone know the diffence of each school's mascots.  But I see your point that even the well versed in sports should know the difference.  Anyway.  GO BEAVS!

Bosnia faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing market reforms to its former centrally planned economy. One legacy of that era is greatly overstaffed Industry. Under former dictator Josip Broz Tito, military industries were promoted in the republic resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants and fewer commercially viable firms.\n\nFor the most part in Bosnia's history, agriculture has been based on privately-owned small and inefficient farms, and food has traditionally been a net import for the republic.\n\nWhen it was a part of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina financed many large construction projects throughout that country. The Highway "Bratstvo i jedinstvo", a pan-Yugoslavian project, which linked Ljubljana (Slovenia) - Zagreb (Croatia) - Belgrade (Serbia) - Skopje (Macedonia), was financed by B and H, despite the lack of direct benefit to that region. The funneling of capital to that project resulted in an increase in unemployment and a decrease in production in the region.[citation needed]\n\nThe war caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy. Production fell to 6%, GDP fell 75% and the destruction of physical infrastructure created massive economic trauma. While much of the production capacity has been restored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties.\n\nFigures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004. This and Bosnia's shrinking national debt are positive trends, but high unemployment and a large trade deficit remain cause for concern.\n\nThe national currency is the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark (BAM), which is fixed to the Euro (€1 = KM1.95583) and is therefore very stable. The inflation rate was 1.4% as of 2005.\n\n \nLegal tender coins from Bosnia-HerzegovinaYearly inflation is the lowest in comparison to other countries that were formerly part of Yugoslavia. The inflation rate was 1.9% in 2004,[6] and international debt was $3.1 billion (2005 est); making it the smallest amount of debt owed from the former Yugoslav countries (Serbia and Montenegro's international debt is $15.43 billion (2005 est), while Croatia is at $29.28 billion (2005 est)). Real GDP growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian Central Bank of BiH and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has one of the best income equality rankings in the world, ranked eighth among the world's 193 nations.0	are all priests gay? it seems to me that from all of the media coverage on "the scandal in the church" that the only kids priests are going after and raping are little boys... are all priests gay sodomists or is that just my take on the world? no. it's like asking, are all muslims terrorists?...unfortunately, the bad ones make a negative impression on the good ones.2	What is the cost of a laparascopic appendicitis surgery when you have no insurance?

The clavicle of each of these critters has been modified through evolution to suit the critter's particular mode of lifestyle.\n\nThe bat's clavicle is a long, strong bone that articulates with the scapula and the sternum.  It is one of the chief supports of the bat's pectoral girdle, and is important in keeping the thorasic cavity from being crushed when the bat sweeps its wings during flight.  The bat's clavicle is much more mobile than most mammal's, sliding laterally and ventrally during the power stroke of the wing.\n\nThe cat, however, has a very reduced clavicle.  In the felids, the clavicle is barely more than an ossified hunk lodged in the muscle structure of the forelimbs.  This accomodation is due to the narrow and upright stance of the feline body.  It allows for greater freedom of movement, as well as the ability to squeeze through tighter openings than a broad shouldered mammal might be able to.  \n\nThe clavicle of a monkey, or indeed most primates, including humans acts as a strut to stabilize the shoulder joint against the sternum.  This broad shouldered, strong strut support helps increase the strength of arm movements despite the highly flexible and mobile humerus/scapula joint.  This combination of strength and flexibility is what allows primates such as gibbons, chimps, spider monkeys, and to some extent even humans to brachiate, travelling by swinging from branch to branch.  It is also what allows us to throw objects such as rocks, spears, and footballs with both accuracy and power.\n\nThe mole's clavicle is very unusual for a mammal.  It is extremely robust and strong, and articulates directly with the humerus instead of attaching to the scapula.  This helps form an incredibly powerful set of supports for the pectoral girdle and muscles, which moles use for digging deeply and quickly through hardened dirt.4	I have a laptop(Model: hp Compaq nx6110).

I have one more year at school and am doing a levels in economics biology and maths (dropping maths next year and doing english and history). it has always bin drilled into me to just attend uni after i finish school but i dont want to.  some people say im wasting my ability as im fairly bright, what other options do i have? If you study the largest countries and their economic influence in the world what do you see the future calls for?\n\nI see: Languages (Mandarin Chinese; English; and another language - but for sure the first 2); International Business.  You have done the economics - continue but in International Language.  I'd see your counselor and see if you can do your last year maybe in a university overseas that they approve of (accept transcripts). My niece is going to Guangzhou University (Guangzhou used to be Canton) and is studying Mandarin and International Business.  Many students from UK and other countries around the world - they have realized w.the world is heading.  \n\nNext question: WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?  That is so important. Anymore, remember, companies don't hire you for life - so you have to be motivated, HAPPY, and be willing to move/change be flexible.  \n\nSo a major and a minor is important.\n\nIf you w/not so far along, I'd say fields in medicine that are needed.  For example, in the State of NC we only have 74 pediatric dentists, can you believe?  Also, in the USA, we are hiring nurses from around the world to fill our vacancies. \n\nSo what to do. First and foremost make an inventory of your strengths and weaknesses - you know which they are. BE BRUTAL with yourself - nobody needs to see this list, if you don't want.\n\nNext, list of what you want and definitely don't want out of life - next 5/10 years - can't go further than that.\n\nDo you have a labor department that will give you a census of jobs and what jobs are hard to fill?  We have it in the USA and you could focus on something you like on that list.\n\nIf you have doubts - maybe ask a company tolet you work during the summer/intern to see if this is something that attracts you.\n\nAnother area of concern because we are getting much older and we can't rely any longer on taking care of our elders at home....so that generation will need help - professional help?

I do not have the money to see a doctor so I need to fight feeling sad all alone. Please give me pointers on how to be happy all day everyday. There is no way to be happy all day every day, if you were happy absolutly all the time you would probably be the most envied person on earth.\nThe trick is not to try to be happy aLl the time because that it unrealistic - imagine saying "I'm so happy my dog has died" or "I lost my job today, which was nice".  You should try to be happy most of the time.\n\nYou should not bother seeing a doctor about depression - all they will do is send you to a psychiatrist who will perscribe antidepressants almost before you sit down.  Antidepressants basically work by altering your brain chemistry to ensure you do not feel emotional extremes, unfortuantly this means you can't really enjoy anything fully, get angry, or even feel empathy.  I've tried antidepressants and would rather burn my own hands off then take them again.\n\nWhat you should do is:\n- drink more fruit juice and eat more fruit.\n- drink more water.\n- work less hours at your job unless you enjoy your job in which case work more.\n- watch less TV and go out more.\n- never stay in the house alone, if you don't know anyone in your town then go out and meet people.\n- get a pet.\n\nMost people suffer from depression because they don't have anything worthwhile to do.  They work, eat, and watch crap on TV.  This is a worthless life and very unfufilling.  You need to do good and benificial things and make worthwhile achievements.  \nIt may seem easier to be miserable and alone all the time with only the TV, and your own depression for company but actually it takes far less effort to go out and have fun.  It took me five years to realise the simple truth that I am loneliest when I am alone and most miserable when I have time to be miserable.  If you are busy and with friends you will have fun, if you are having fun you are happy.\nEven if you are a hermit, or a misanthrope then you can have fun with a dog, or cat, or trained fighting monkey - just go places and do stuff.4	Is there a way to find out how a person is by their IP address.?

Therefore, WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE KOBE SO MUCH?!?! He merely does what it takes for his team to have the best chance for winning. Be that agressively attacking with his offensive ability or dishing assists. If you watch closely, LeBron actually does much of the same. No, if LBJ did it, they'd blame the girl. I love the sin aspect, too. They love to say that Kobe cheated on his wife. Well, Lebron just had a child out of wed-lock. Adultery & fornification are both sins, so get off Kobe's jock.\n\nKobe cheated on his wife and paid the woman hush money. Jordan cheated on his wife and paid the woman hush money. Kobe punched Samaki Walker. Jordan punched Steve Kerr. Kobe (allegedly) ran off a coach(Phil Jackson). Jordan (allegedly) ran off a coach (Doug Collins). Kobe gives overly polished post-game interviews. Jordan gave overly polished post-game interviews. Kobe hasn't won a title w/o Shaq. Jordan never won a title w/o Pippen. Kobe talks trash on and off the court. Jordan talked trash on and off the court. Kobe shoots too much. Jordan shot too much. Kobe goes after teammates when they make mistakes. Jordan went after teammates when they made mistakes. Kobe is dominating his era. Jordan dominated his era. Kobe has titles. Jordan has titles.\n\nTwo different men, very similar lives. The answer to the question is in the threat. Kobe threatens the the Jordan lovers. He always has. They hated Kobe when he was squeaky clean. I know people that hated Kobe when he took Brandy to the prom. Even then, he threatened their precious Jordan.5	Fantasy Baseball - Esteban Loaiza start? Should I start Esteban tomorrow vs Minnesota in a 5x5 league? Esteban Loaiza.  He should be good for a win.  Minnesota hasn't done too great this year.  Oakland has a pretty good offence, great defence and great pitching and bullpen.\n\nLoaiza is 10-8 vs Minnesota in his career.  He has allowed 54 earned runs has 94 punch outs, and a 3.71 ERA.\n\nHe last played against Minny in 2004 whily playing for the White Sox and fared decent against them with a 1-1 record and 4.09 ERA.\n\nHe didn't play them in 2005 due to being in the NL for the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn 2003, at Minny's field, the Metrodome, he was 1-0, allowing 3 runs on 9 hits and had an ERA under 4.\n\nHowever, All time at the Metrodome, Loaiza is 3-6 with a 5.12 ERA and only 42Ks in 11 games and 58 innings pitched.\n\nAgain, however, Loaiza usually pitches his best baseball in the month of April.  He's compiled a record of 18-6.\n\nHis home-away stats are not relevant to this situation as they are pretty similar.\n\nIt's a toss-up.  I really don't see a problem from having anyone start any games, because they're usually bound to get you a few K's and potentially a win.  All public leagues don't count losses against the scoring and only ERA is affected.  Being early in the season, most pitchers are giving up a lot of runs.\n\nGood luck.\nCraig1	How do you find the perimeter and area of a right triangle?

I has some rough sex last night and it went on for 2 hours its was good but my cochie is sore any remedies?? He F@#Ked the Sh*t outta me and im all smiles but the my stuff is sore. Help This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick).  It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is.  During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues,  which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing.  Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.2	Has anyone else ever hallucinated for no apparent reason? lol i think im turning into that crazy dude on the street corner that spends his day yelling jiberish.\n\nanyway, i was driving with my girlfriend today and i swear i saw a car go off the road. it was really real. she was really confused. i talked her into making a second pass and i was gonna go help, but she was right and nothing was there. anyway, just wondering if this has happened to anyone else. first time its happened to me. ill probably go to the doctor if it happens again to make sure i dont have a tumor or something else wrong with me, im guessing its from lack of sleep because i didnt get much sleep this weekend and ive had to get up at 4:30 every day this week for work. yes, i have too.

Precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration are all terms that sound familiar, yet may not mean much to you. They are all part of the water cycle, a complex process that not only gives us water to drink, fish to eat, but also weather patterns that help grow our crops.  \n\nWater is an integral part of life on this planet. It is an odorless, tasteless, substance that covers more than three-fourths of the Earth's surface. Most of the water on Earth, 97% to be exact, is salt water found in the oceans. We can not drink salt water or use it for crops because of the salt content. We can remove salt from ocean water, but the process is very expensive.\n\nOnly about 3% of Earth's water is fresh. Two percent of the Earth's water (about 66% of all fresh water) is in solid form, found in ice caps and glaciers. Because it is frozen and so far away, the fresh water in ice caps is not available for use by people or plants. That leaves about 1% of all the Earth's water in a form useable to humans and land animals. This fresh water is found in lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and in the ground. (A small amount of water is found as vapor in the atmosphere.)4	anyone know of any good voltmoding sites diagrams would be great if possible please.? radeon 9600pro This forum site is the best place to ask the more technical questions, Start a thread and without fail you will get a detailed full spec response within an hour.

It was a sale of a business by a private company which required, like many other sales involving work in the U.S., review by the administration to make sure it meets legal muster.  Nor was the "deal" covert -- it was made public several months ago (when the leading bidder for the London company's business -- a Singapore company-- withdrew their offer).\n\nSo, as a matter of legal fairness, if the company has followed all the U.S. laws there is no proper reason to disallow the sale.   To do so, on no legal grounds, is to tell an Arab country which has, since 9-11 been very helpful in combatting terrorism (in precisely such areas as port security, esp. container inspection), that the rules we apply to all other nations don't apply to them.  That would also discourage other Arab countries thinking of co-operating with us from thinking it's worth doing so.\n\nThere may also be some specific ways the UAE has helped us in the past few years that the administration cannot, for security reasons, give details about  (i.e., you don't want to divulge what you know about terrorist groups you are pursuing, nor all the sources of that information, because that would put them at risk and dry up potential sources, who would fear being outted themselves).   Of course, the administration would want to CONTINUE to get this kind of help and nixing business sales might threaten such assistance going forward.\n\nAs for the question, 'why a UAE business, not an American one?'   Simple answer: NO American companies bid to purchase the London company's business.  They were welcome to do so.  But, in fact, there really are not any American companies vying to manage these port terminal operations.  And again, the administration was never "pushing" for Dubai Port Worlds to make this purchase.  That agreement was made between the parties before the U.S. government had any involvement in the matter.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to inform yourself about what exactly the "business" is, who would be doing the actual work etc.  (Short answer -- it is basically about loading and unloading boats in specific port terminals, NOT running the entire port, much less port security;   the on site workers will continue to be the AMERICAN dock workers who worked for the London company selling the business.)\n\nThese, any a few other points, were made (more clearly) in an email from Bush administrations officials a couple of weeks ago.

Actually a very good choice for a post work out meal if you combine it with some good protein.Shorter chain carbohydrates are a good choice after a work out.Basically what you're getting is maltose(from whatever grain they're made from) and glucose and possibly fructose from the syrup(that includes honey if you prefer that).\nA post work out meal has been shown to be most effective within 15-30 minutes afterwords.This isn't just anecdotal evidence there are studies on such things.You're more likely to replace muscle and liver glycogen if you eat within this window of opportunity.That basically means that those carbs are shunted away from fat cells(adipose tissue) and the carbs stored down as glycogen(stored carbohydrate).\nCombining both milk and eggs with this meal with further enhance recovery as well as cause a greater secretion of growth factors(IGF1 and growth hormone) as well as testosterone.If you use protein powders than a whey protein would be best as it's quickly digested and assimilated and has the highest biological value in humans.2	Preventing menstrual cycle?

Did one thousand among the romans mean the samething among semetic people. The modern base ten system uses ten symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, ...,9)\nwith place values that are powers of ten. These symbols are commonly called\nHindu-Arabic numerals. Although a base ten system seems natural to those\nwho have ten Þngers, in times past people have used many different kinds of\nnumerals and various bases in addition to base ten.\nOther numeration systems that have existed historically used base Þve,\nbase twenty, and base sixty. In fact almost all societies have used a number\nsystem based on 5, 10, or 20. This is understandable because of human\nanatomy. Counting on the Þve Þngers of one hand, all ten Þngers, or all\ntwenty digits is natural and useful. The quinary system (base 5) or vigesimal\n(base 20) or a combination of these two were used by early societies in the\nAmericas including almost all Eskimo tribes, some native North American\nsocieties, and almost all peoples indigenous to Central and South America.\nAlthough the quinary and vigesimal systems were also found in some societies\nin northern Siberia and Africa the decimal system used today dominated\nhistory. However, with advent of computers in this century bases two, eight\nand sixteen have come into prominence. Computers count best using only\ntwo digits. It is interesting to note that certain Polish engineers built a\ncomputer in the late 1950s and early 1960s that used a base of negative 2.\nIn order to understand numeration systems it is important to know the\ndistinction between place value systems and additive systems. In additive\nsystems (Roman numerals, for example) a numeration symbol has the same\nmeaning no matter where it is placed in writing the number. So, for example,\nthe Roman numeral V means Þve whether it is placed before or after the\nnumeral X. Thus XV and VX both represent Þfteen in an additive system,\nalthough as we discover VX would certainly be non-standard. The values\nten (X) and Þve (V) are added to obtain Þfteen.\nThe position of each numeral is important in positional (place value)\nnumber systems, but not in additive systems. For example, in order to\nrepresent Þfty or Þve hundred in the base ten place value system, the symbol\n5 is moved over to the left one or two places (50 or 500), putting a zero\nin the empty places. However, in order to represent Þfty or Þve hundred in\nan additive system multiple copies of the ten or hundred need to be used\n(XXXXX or CCCCC) or new symbols need to be invented (L and D in\nRoman numerals).\nPlace value (or positional) systems can continue to use the same set of\nsymbols since the value of the symbol changes with repositioning. The value\nof each symbol is multiplied by a power of the systems base. For example, in\nbase ten (decimal) different positions of the numeral Þve will represent Þve,\nÞfty, and Þve hundred. Hence, the symbol 5 in each of the following numbers\nrepresents different quantities because of its position.\n in 215 the Þve represents Þve (5 × 100 )\n in 354 the Þve represents Þfty (5 × 101 )\n in 567 the Þve represents Þve hundred (5 × 103 )\nThe number one hundred twenty four is represented as 124 in the base ten\nsystem, where the 1 signiÞes one hundred, the 2 signiÞes two tens and the\n4 signiÞes four ones. This number is written in expanded form as follows:3	how do you graph a sin graph?

A report by the Evangelical Alliance published this week says, "violent revolution should be regarded as a viable response if government legislation encroaches on basic religious rights. The church is urged to come to a consensus that at some point there is not only the right but the duty to disobey the state."  \n\nThis is the same weirdo cult that Haggert was leader of.  Bush consulted regularly with Haggert. This is an excellent observation and connecting of dots!\n\nPresident Bush spent years and years politically empowering religious extremists, even though behind closed doors they were calling them "boorish" and "nuts" (as it was reported by David Kuo, an evangelical Christian conservative in his book, "Tempting Faith").\n\nThe Bush administration should have been very wary of what they wished for in this case. Such a hypocritical alliance indicates their political greed is extremely reckless and very harmful to our country.2	Is there anything to take or do for side effects of Wellbutrin?

Probably the standards, Ice and heat.\nMaybe a whirlpool bath to keep things loose.\nE\nasy stretching after the run, but NOT too much before a workout.\nSo...\nLight workout, then stretch, then the heavy workout.  Afterwards, another stretch, and then any therapy you feel is helpful, such as the ice, etc...\n\nBut, if you have a structural issue, it may never resolve. It might be a good idea to see a medical professional to verify you you are not causing 'future damage' to your knee by virtue of toughing through your activity.  It would be a shame to have a lifetime of knee problems because you didn't know you had a chronic knee issue.4	how  do i   make my laptop faster?

In this instace, lore almost interects with science.  Turkey does contain Tryptophan, an amino acid which is a natural sedative.  But trytophan doesn't act on the brian unless it is taken on an empty stomach with no protein present, and the amount eaten even during a holiday feast is generally too small to have an appreciable effect.  That lazy, lethargic feeling so many are overcome by at the conclusion of a festive season meal is most likey due to the combination of drinking alcohol and over eating a carbohydrate-rich repast, as well as some other factors.5	Between india and pakistan, which batsman has the most aggregate runs in test cricket?

I got some sample from the doctor to take it, but i scared to death of the side effects.. I need help with my aneixty, but i soo scared of taking new meds... I guess you can call it a fear of mine!! lol What  side effects have you experiance with this, and what did it do with your weight?? I have already taken paxil and lexapro and either work for me.. Paxil made me gain 16 pounds and lexapro made me sick as a dog!!! Here are the cost vs. benefits of taking Effexor\n\nWe'll start with the benefits.\nEffexor is a multiple reuptake inhibitor, which modulates two neuro transmitters in your brain, norepinephrine and serotonine.  Once at a theraputic range, Effexor and take you out of the most deepest and darkest depression imagineable. \n\nHere are the cons (and they are not exaggerated)\nEffexor is the most addicting of all of the antidepressants on the market today.  Not addicting in a way similar to fun drugs.  Because of the complex way Effexor works, your brain wil become dependant to the point where Effexor may become a permanent part of your life.   The withdrawal syndrome from effexor is the absolute worst amongst the serotogenic drugs.  Due to the short elimination half life (amount of time it stays in yoru system) you can experience withdrawal by missing just one dose!  Effexor is the hardest antidepressant to stop taking.  Let's say you reach the therautic dosage of 300mg, you will have to taper off in 30mg incriments, per week.  That means it will take at least 10 weeks to wean off, that is, if your brain lets you.\n\nEffexor is only recommended for deep deep depression and try taking anything else, unless it is your last resort.\n\nHope this helps7	Is the end of Titanic possible? At the end of Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are on top of the stern of the ship as that half starts to descend into the Atlantic. He tells her to "take a deep breath and don't stop kicking." Where it is true the ship would cause a great deal of suction because of its size, is the "deep breath and kick" realistic? Could someone actually have survived doing that? Could an olympic swimmer do it? Or is it completely unrealistic?

"Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith . . . we need believing people." Strongly disagree.  Secular morals involve things like "Do not kill people because it is wrong."  Whereas religious morals follow the tune of, "Do not do this or you will go to hell."  It is like speed limits.  Most people follow them because they don't want a ticket, not because they know it is safer.  Secular people follow morals because it is right, not to avoid punishment.\n\nIt is so sad that people think morals and religion are interrelated.4	After installing internal HDD as a external ones by using USB 2.0 TO IDE cable,I cannot locate the 'J' drive  First off, is the HDD already partitioned and formatted?

This can produce heat, damaging effects, or even severe injury depending on the strength and frequency of the EMFs.\n\nIons are very important to various physiological processes, same for electron transfer.  \n\nToo much heat damages cells.\n\nTime, distance, shielding and field intensity are important factors in limiting the damages.\n\nUnder certain circumstances EMF can slowly cook a person.\n\nThere are stories about Navy people using Target Acquisition (Fire Control) radars to cook seagulls in flight.\n\nNuclear radiation can affect the nuclei of atoms in addition to the effects for EMF.\n\nYes, EMF is a type of potentially harmful radiation.  Gamma rays and light are powerful varieties of EMF.\n\nEven weak or slow EMF at lower frequencies can sometimes produce headaches and disorientation.\n\nCows in pastures have been adversely affected from both overhead and underground power lines.\n\nDeath is possible.\n\nWe live in a sea of weak EMFs.  Strong exposures can occur from nearby antennas, especially those used for broadcasting or relaying communications via radio or microwave.\n\nThere are meters available for monitoring EMF intensities.\n\nThe ionosphere and ozone layers of the atmosphere protect us from damaging rays from space.\n\nTV cameras must be wrapped in aluminum foil in some bad EMF areas.\n\nI live in a mobile home, this affords some protection too.\n\nGenerally microwaves and other shorter, more powerful wavelengths are more damaging.\n\nSunburn is a form of EMF damage.  Similarly you can see in medical work burns from other types of EMF exposure.7	If you were stranded on an island & could only bring one item, what would it be?

Some GPA scales are on 100, some are on a 4 scale and some are on a 5 scale.  A GPA scale can be on any scale, which is why it is followed by the maximum (such as your 94.6 out of 100).  There is no national or global standardization, so a 95 at one school may not be better than a 85 at another.  It is very subjective.\n\nWith that said, you can take your 94.6, divide by 100, and then multiple by whatever scale you want.  Your 94.6 on a 4.0 scale would be a 3.784.7	Do u have any facts about the original saxophone?  Check out this page: http://www.saxpics.com/sax/index.htm7	Can you unscramble this word?

When Congress approves a bill and sends it to the President, he is allowed 10 days to either approve (sign) or reject (veto) it.  If he does neither then the bill becomes a law by default.  However, if Congress adjourns before those 10 days are up, then the President can do neither and the bill will not become law.  The rationale is that the legislature has to be in session to affirm that a bill would become a law without the President's signature if he did nothing; if they're not in session, then a bill that the President has not acted on cannot become law.0	What is the estimated percentage of people who are gay in the world?

I'm thinking of selling my old skis and wondering how adjustable the bindings are for different boots, so I can advise prospective buyers if the skis will work. The bindings are not demo bindings (Salomon 850) and are mounted the normal way, by drilling.  My current boots are 313mm in length (from heel to toe) and I was wondering if the bindings will only work with boots that are within a millimeter of the ones they were mounted for, or if there's about a centimeter or so of adjustment possible. If you had the bindings mounted yourself, with your boots, the installer should have set the bindings at a middle setting.  You should be able to adjust the bindings about an inch forward or backwards.  You could check, there is a tab at the back of the binding that you can lift with a regular screw driver...lift and slide the rear binding.3	quotes .. help? these quotes that i not quite understand ... plz help\n"no one knews what he can do unless he tries"\n"the man who insists he is as good as any body"\n"the greatest mistake in life you can make is to be affair that you will make a mistake" 1. If you never tried to swim, for example, can you do it? You don't know, right? You'll have to try swimming and then you will know if you can do it or not.\n2.The man who insist he is as good as any body talks nonsense because he would have to be as good as the best and it is o.k. but also he would have to be as bad as the worst--is it possible to be the best and the worst of all people at the same time? No, thus he is a fool.\n3.The fear of making a mistake robs you from the opportunities to learn, because our mistakes are our best teachers. For example, if a new emigrant is afraid to speak a word in English  because he or she might make a mistake, they will never learn to speak the language. Isn't it better to make mistakes and learn the language than to remain in this country without the communicating skills? So the greatest mistake of this emigrant can came from a fear of making a mistake.  Sorry I made the explanation so long. . .6	I just bought my first home and i want to rent it? where do i get a free rental agreement. I have no idea what they say or anything. It's my first home. Did you sign an occupancy affidavit at the closing?\n\nDo not use a "free" rental agreement or one of those standard forms from Staples or whatever.  I could tell you hundreds of horror stories from people who used those agreements and screwed themself royally.  Same thing with deciding to be a landlord when you know absolutely nothing about it.\n\nDo yourself a great big favor.  Make an appointment with the top landlord/tenant lawyer in your area.  Make sure that is their specialty.  Pay them to do a lease that is specific for your area and your needs.  Have them give you a crash course on local landlord/tenant law and how it applies to you and your proposed situation.  The $100 to $200 it costs you now could save you thousands and thousands in the end.\n\nA true horror story from my office:\n\nWoman rents out her condo when she is transferred.  She buys a "legal" lease from one of those landlord sites and uses it.  A year later, she decides to sell the condo and make some serious money while the market is hot.  This way she can buy a new place where she now lives, pay cash and have a huge chunk of change left over.\n\nShe gives the tenants 30 days notice a month before their lease is up.  The tenants say they aren't going anywhere.  So, she comes to our office to evict them.  We tell her "Sorry, but your tenant doesn't ever have to leave if they don't want to as long as they pay their rent because 1) in this county, if you rent a condo to someone, it must state in big bold letters at the top that it is a condo and subject to sale or else you are required to give them a 2 YEAR notice if you are ending their tenancy if you want to sell the place, 2) leases in this state automatically renew themselves on a month to month basis and you don't have a right to evict simply because a lease is ending under the anti-eviction act of this state and 3) this $9.99 bargain of a lease does not contain the all-important "right of re-entry" clause needed in order to evict for cause in this state, so the fact that you didn't tell them in the lease that it is a condo doesn't even really matter at this point.  They don't ever have to leave even if they did give you cause to evict."\n\nShe's hysterical because prices more than doubled in the past year.  Her 150K condo is under contract for 320K, and now she can't sell it because of this.  She wants to sue the online landlord site because they told her the lease is "perfectly legal".  We have to tell her she doesn't have a case because ... the lease is perfectly legal, it's just not in her best interests. \n\nDon't be a schmuck over $100 to $200.  Pay a professional for their expertise and advice.3	explain how the study of psychology and propaganda are linked?

So I'm writing a paper about the steel mills in Pittsburgh and the treatment of the workers and the modernist attitude of neglect towards the workers, and one of the things I notice, is that Carnegie especially believed that the ends justified the means, that if he did good work and was charitable, that would wipe out all of his earlier transgressions.\n\nAt the same time as he believed this, the Braddock mills had a twelve hour work day.  You worked all day or all night in the steel mills (doing dangerous manual labor) and then once a week you would work a twenty four hour shift in the mills.  You had every Sunday off.  \n\nThe death rate in the mills was much higher during the twenty four hour shift than other times, due to exhaustion.\n\nOn the other hand, those mills built America.  All the great railroads and early skyscrapers that fueled the American economy came out of there.\n\nSo do the ends (building America) justify the means (killing and maiming and maltreating workers)? It is impossible to achieve moral ends through immoral means. Don't forget, those workers wouldn't have worked at the steel mill if they thought they could have gotten a better job someplace else, so Carnegie et. al. did those men a favor. Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work. Nothing wrong there.9	Anyone else happy about there being no more election commercials? I am!\n\nThey were getting very annoying. Glad it's all over with.

Lets consider after the flood, What religion was Noah and the many generation after Noah before Judaism.? There was still a large period of time between Noah and the covenants of Israel, and Christianity. While Noah himself may have had a person relationship with God, his decendants didn't.\nCuriously! did having a personal relationship with God save him and if so because I have a personal relationship with God then I\nmust likewise be saved.? Thanks for the thought-provoking question. It really made me think. Noah was not a Christian, he was not even a Jew. He lived long before Moses, even before Abraham. \n\nWhatever his religion was, it certainly was not Judaism or Christianity or Islam. This means that these religions are not the only ways to know God or to live a life of worth. \n\nHow about Enoch?  He walked with God. What was his religion? That means one can walk with God and not be in one of these religons!8	what does it mean if a guy calls you wierd who you dated? and how to you get him&#92;to think youare unweird... i think it means he thinks your wierd.0	whats the...?

My mother is divorcing my father after almost 30 years of marriage and I need to know what we're entitles to.I'm 18 and know I'm not entitled to child support.Both their names are on the mortgage payments and we have 2 cars both paid off.He earns about 3 times as much as she does and we're considering selling the house.How much are we entitled to.We live in Western Australia.Thanks. This is a tough question under any circumstances let alone the one your family is going through. \n\nFirst check with the providence you are in and ask the magistrates exactly what your MOTHER is entitled to, since you are over the age of 18 and not legally a deed holder in the real estate, it will have to be your mother who does the asking and who would legally gain anything from the divorce. \n\nAlso check into whether Australia has any alimony laws, [law libararys are alwasy a big help online] and since your father makes more then your mother, if they do have alimony then she would be entitled to a percentiage/payment on a monthly basis from your fathers wages providing she doesn't remarry. \n\nIt gets really tricky here because it really depends on the laws of the country as well as the indiviual laws of each state/providence so collectively all will determine IF and HOW much your mother will get or is entitled to. \n\nSo whatever you do, SEEK AN ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY. \n\nDivorce is NEVER the time to try to skimp on fees or to try to represent yourself or your family....an attorney is not only knowledgable in the laws of each state/providence and country but they also have access to hidden or obscure laws and loopholes which will gain you or entitled you to more then meets the eye per se. \n\nSo again; never guess and or take ANYONE'S [including mine] words at face value...seek counsel ASAP. \nGood Luck.4	I'm using Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP Pro.

The name Romanov was adopted in the 16th cent. by a family of boyars (great nobles) that traced its beginnings to the 14th cent. Czar Ivan IV took as his first wife Anastasia Romanov. Anastasia's brother, Nikita, was a regent for her son, Czar Feodor I. Nikita's son, Philaret, whom Boris Godunov forced to take monastic vows, was patriarch of Moscow from 1619 until his death in 1633. Michael, Philaret's son, was chosen in 1613 as czar of Russia; his election ended a turbulent period in Russian history. Except for the period from 1722 to 1797, the succession was thereafter regulated by the law of primogeniture.\nThe direct successors of Michael were Alexis (1645–76) and Feodor III (1676–82). Ivan V and Peter I (Peter the Great) reigned jointly under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna until 1689, when Peter assumed sole rule. In 1721, Peter took the title emperor of Russia in addition to that of czar; the new title was borne by all his successors. His succession decree of 1722 denounced the law of primogeniture and declared that the choice of a successor lay solely with the ruling emperor.\n\nIn 1723, Peter made his consort joint ruler as Catherine I, and after his death (1725) she continued to rule until she died in 1727. Peter's son by his first marriage, Czarevich Alexis, had been executed in 1718. His second marriage, with Catherine, produced two daughters: Anna, who married Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, and Elizabeth. They were bypassed in the succession of 1727 in favor of Peter II (1727–30), son of Czarevich Alexis.\n\nPeter II was the last of the direct male Romanov line, and on his death Anna, duchess of Courland, a daughter of Ivan V, ascended the throne. She died without heirs and was succeeded (1740) by Ivan VI, a great-grandson of Ivan V. He was a German, son of the duke of Brunswick and of Anna Leopoldovna, a princess of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe rule of foreigners was unpopular, and Peter I's daughter Elizabeth executed a coup in 1741 and was proclaimed czarina. Her nephew Peter III succeeded her in 1762 but was deposed (and probably assassinated) that year in a coup that made his consort, a princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, empress as Catherine II (Catherine the Great). There was some argument as to the paternity of Catherine's son and successor, Paul I (1796–1801), but it is now generally believed that he was the son of Peter III.\n\nPaul, who was assassinated, restored the succession by primogeniture in 1797. His successors reigned as Alexander I (1801–25), Nicholas I (1825–55), Alexander II (1855–81; assassinated), Alexander III (1881–94), and Nicholas II (1894–1917). The marriage of Nicholas II to Princess Alix of Hesse (Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna) brought hemophilia into the family; their son, Czarevich Alexis (1904–18), was afflicted with the disease. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Nicholas II and his immediate family were executed. The members of the Romanov family who escaped execution fled abroad.8	Why would a rapist tramitize a persons entire life just for 30 seconds of pleasure?  Any event that challenges someone's view of reality can be traumatizing. If a person is in a place she thought was safe, her sense of safety is threatened. If she is with someone she trusted, her sense of trust is threatened. Rape is very personal and painful for a woman. It is terrifying to have absolutely no control over a situation. A man who is dominating her is frightening. Maybe the worst thing is that rape can affect a woman's (and even more so a girl's) ability to engage in pleasurable sex. Furthermore, the act of telling someone (the police) about it can be embarrassing and frightening. Suddenly everything is out of the hands of the woman (again, even worse for a girl).\nRape isn't really about pleasure - a rapist is often compensating for a lot of real serious problems. Date rape can often be the worst for the loss of trust - not only in the other person, but also in the woman's faith in her ability to judge the character of a person.6	What does a salvage diver actually do and how do you get into the industry?  it depends where you are but a salvage diver can salvage many things boats cars snowmobiles 4 wheelers i know i hired 1 last winter when i sent me and my wheeler through the ice on messalonskee lake in oakland me.2	i have dry cough, colds & a sorethroat.? should i stop (temporarily) taking my vitamin C while taking the meds to cure my cough,colds & sorethroat? serious answer please. for the sore throat.. use warm water & some cayenne pepper... this does work.. i read it online with the herbs making you better instead of meds and when I had this sore throat it was really bad I did that and I gargle some and each time a little went down my throat.. i know it might be hot but it works...\nAlso do the hottie toddie..\n\nits warm tea, some honey, & some cheap brandy... \ndrink some of that too and that will make your throat better too and even your cold\nhope you get well soon8	can a girl ask a boy out fot a nice romantic date for 2?

People yelling "bingo!" all the time?  Ha!  There are people who have won the lottery twice!

Hey do you mean Ayurveda?\n\nAyurveda (आयुर्वेद Sanskrit: ayu—life; veda—knowledge of) or ayurvedic medicine is a more than 2,000 year old comprehensive system of medicine based on a holistic approach rooted in Vedic culture. Its conspicuous use of the word veda, or knowledge, reveals its role in early Hinduism and describes its hallowed place in India. Ayurveda also had a tradition of surgery. Two early texts of Ayurveda are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita.\n\nThe Charaka and Sushruta Samhitās are compendiums of two traditions rather than texts authored by single authors. A third tradition is that of the Kāshyapas. The scholarly traditions of ayurveda date back to the time of the Buddha, who died (mahaparinirvana) in approximately 400 BCE. Some plant remedies of ayurveda are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature 2nd millennium BC, but the formal doctrines of the three humours and other key ayurvedic ideas are first mentioned in the Buddhist Canonical literature. Both the Sushruta and Charaka Samhitās are the product of several editorial hands, having been revised and supplemented over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe scholar Vāgbhata, who lived in Sind at the beginning of the 7th century AD, produced a grand synthesis of earlier ayurvedic materials in a verse work called Ashtānga Samhita. Another work associated with the same author, the Asthanga Samgraha, contains much the same material in a more diffuse form, written in a mixture of prose and verse. The relationship between these two works, and a third intermediate compilation, is still a topic of active research. The works of Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata are considered canonical and reverentially called the Vriddha Trayi, "the triad of ancients"; or Brhat Trayi, "the greater triad." In the early eighth century, Mādhav wrote his Nidāna, a work on etiology, which soon assumed a position of authority. In the 79 chapters of this book, he lists diseases along with their causes, symptoms, and complications.\n\nThe vast majority of Ayurvedic therapies are herbal compounds. Some alchemical preparations start to enter the ayurvedic pharmacopieia towards the end of the 1st millennium AD in works such as those of Ugraditya (8th century AD)and Sarngadhara (14th century AD). It also provides therapies for the treatment of various vegetable and animal toxins like scorpion, spider and snake venom. It has a whole science of toxicology called agada-tantra as one of the eight branches of traditional Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic idea is that the organism adapts to the environment and its food, climate etc. This principle of adaptation is called satyma. Through introducing small amounts of a food or medicine, the organism can adapt to it and learn to resist it.\n\nAyurveda became increasingly symptom-based, treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the root cause. However, it is important to note that Ayurveda was originally a consciousness based system of health care. Its philosophy, expressed in modern terms, is to strengthen the immune system.\n\n\nQualities\nIt could be said that the simple essence of ayurveda is knowledge and awareness of the qualities of nature – called gurvadi gunah. By understanding the qualities inherent in the environment, in foodstuffs, in activities, etc., one gains an appreciation of their effects on the individual constitution through the principle of similarities; i.e., that similarities cause increase while dissimilarities cause decrease. Thus hot qualities in the environment or diet will increase hot qualities in the body.\n\nThe gurvadi gunah are listed in Vagbhata's Ashtanga Hrdayam as:\n\nGuru (heavy) – laghu (light) \nManda (slow) – tikshna (quick, sharp) \nHima (cold) – ushna (hot) \nSnigdha (unctuous) – ruksha (dry) \nSlakshna (smooth) – khara (rough) \nSandra (solid) – drava (liquid) \nMrdu (soft) – kathina (hard) \nSthira (stable) – cala (mobile) \nSuk1	is there any end for the galaxy and the world?  You must mean universe, not galaxy.\n\nWe live on planet Earth,  which is in a solar system. A solar system consists of a star (we call ours the sun),  planets which orbit the star, and maybe other debris and gases. Solar systems are in galaxies. Our galaxy is the Milky Way. It's a barred spiral galaxy and it's a big one. Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. That means, traveling at the speed of light, it'd take you 100,000 years to get from one side to the other if you went straight across the disk.\n\nOutside of the galaxy is mainly empty space (heck, galaxies have trillions of stars and massive clouds of dust and gases and most of it is still mainly empty space). There may be rogue stars or junk that got flug out of a galaxy here and there but they're generally few.\n\nDoes the universe have a boundary? Probably,  but the nature of it probably isn't anything we'd be familiar with...not like a wall or anything. Can we ever get there? No, we are well within the universe and even if we could travel the speed of light and live forever, it's thought the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate so we'd still never get to the edge, and if by change we mysteriously appeared at the edge and move along with it, there may be some physical process which would prevent us from realizing it.5	What's your starting 11 for England?

Sodas are carbonated, meaning that they have Carbon Dioxide gas dissolved in the liquid.  When a soda goes "flat", almost all the Carbon Dioxide has escaped.\n\nCarbon Dioxide is a gass at any normal pressure/temperature we would deal with soda at (refrigerator, store shelf, ...), and being a gas, its solubility in water depends greatly on two things, the temperature of the solution and the pressure above the solution.\nA lower temperature or higher pressure makes CO2 gas more soluble in water, thus it is always best to keep your botttles closes and in the refrigerator in order to keep the soda from going flat.\n\nThe carbon Dioxide gass dissolved in the water reaches an equilibrium with CO2 that has gotten out of solution and has become trapped inside the bottle above the liquid, when this happens, the amount of CO2 in solution is constant.  When you open the bottle and relieve the pressure above the liquid, the equilibrium is disturned and the gas dissolved in the liquid comes out of solution to try to re-establish the equilibrium.  That is why you see a bunch of bubbles when you open a soda bottle/can, it is the CO2 gas coming out of solution due to the decrease in pressure.4	I am a firs time user of yahoo IM.

When you get a material cold enough (really cold!) you can easily break it! How cold does steel need to be to do this?\n\nThanks!\n\nCould you give me an answer be in C or F. Thanks again. I worked in a Steel Foundry.  It would take a temperature of about 2700 degrees F to completely melt steel.  It took a temperature of just over 3000 degree F to boil it.\n\nNow as for just heating it up to break it, that would be the temperature of the ovens where they put the steel in to heat treat it so that its glowing red and then before you put it in water or oil.  That temperature is around 1500 degrees F if I remember.  They used to break off unwanted parts of the casting at this temperature.\n\nDo, I google search on Heat treating Steel to get your temperature(that wasn't my department)\n\nP.S.

Ever culture all over the world has myths of firebreathing dragons and dinosaur like creatures.  I have heard several stories of those seeing Dinosaurs both in the U.S. and abroad.  Include sources if you could. Over the past hundred years or so, there have been more than a dozen expeditions into the deep jungles of the Congo basin in search of an allegedly dinosaur-like creature called Mokele Mbembe.\n\nRedmond O'Hanlon's account of his failed expedition (Congo Journey, 1996) makes for excellent reading, even though they didn't find anything.\n\nThe 1992 British expedition with William Gibbons has one photograph that in rather unusual, and it is claimed that it may be the head of a Mokele Mbembe.\n\nA 1987 Japanese expedition has some amazingly awful, blurry video footage that they claim is one of the beasts moving slowly through the water, but most of those who have seen it says it looks more like a boat with two people in it, one of whom is standing up.\n\nA 1980 American expedition has some castings of what may be footprints, that appear to be round with three sharp claws on them.  There's no known critter that leaves prints like that.\n\nThere have also been numerous 'sightings' of giant flying reptiles around the world.  It has been spotted in tropical Africa, the US Southwest, Mexico, the Andean highlands of South America and tropical New Guinea.  Dubbed Kangamato by cryptozoologists, some have tried to claim they are surviving remnants of pterosaurs, but there is little to no hard evidence for their existence, and they may well be Byakhee instead.\n\nOther than Nessie, Champie, Ogopogo and other lake critters that have varying degrees of evidence for their existence, those are about the best documented sightings of prehistoric-type reptiles.7	who killed selena? where did she get shot. give info plez and websites thnx Well the best way to find this answer is to watch the movie Selena.Yolanda Saldivar was the name of the lady who killed her and she was her fan club president and manager of Selena's boutique.

Any comments or predictions? I like that but i think the bracket would have to be tweaked with the following.  Conference champions get seeded 1-6, if Notre Dame is ranked #1 at the time of seeding they get the one seed withe the conference champions getting seeds 2-7.  After conference champions then it goes to the polls with the remaining teams getting seeded in order of ranking in the polls.3	need help ASAP!!? for a health project, i have to type a introduction paper using MAL  format. but i have no idea what it is. and the teachers wont tell us what it is. they just told us to go to mal.com but it didnt work out!! could u please help me!! that may be because it is not MAL, it is MLA format.

Any perceptibly manifest phenomenon by experience should simultaneously satisfy two conditions viz.a Magnitude represented by some number of dimensionless ratio or defined units and a Characteristic relating to cognitory discriminative qualities(color,tone, smell etc.).A strong beam of light involving photons satisfies both the above conditions such as intensity in lumens /unit area and a discriminating color such as orange,green or white etc. Hence answer is sought to identify the related attribute since any phenomenon imagined as a numberless dimension will be in contrast to the manifest and ,therefore,beyond the scope of objective experience. of course they are real particles. photons are used to demonstrate the wave nature of light while mesons are smaller sub-atomic particles found and detected in the atom2	In the winter I get these little blisters on the soles of my feet? which eventually cause my skin to peel/flake off.

Yeasts and moulds are fungi - these are fundamentally different from bacteria (about as different as we are from a tree!) - if you're interested check back on what makes different kinds of cell different - eg. plants have a cell wall and animals don't. Fungi produce hyphae (a bit like plant roots) which search for nutrients - these will make the colony look furry. Bacteria are single cell micro-organisms and a colony of them (I'm assuming you're looking at an agar plate) is just a mass of clones of themselves. It will look like a circle (or in liquid suspension a sphere) because cells multiply from the point of infection out. Sometimes they can be blank in the middle where nutrients have run out in the centre so the bacteria there have died (not moved!). That's the main difference - hope that's helped a bit!1	What is the prime factorization in exponents of 2400? for example, the prime factorization in exponents of 56 would be 2 to the third power multiplied by seven. 2400 / 2 = 1200\n1200 / 2 = 600\n600 / 2 = 300\n300 / 2 = 150\n150 / 2 = 75\n75 / 3 = 25\n25 / 5 = 5\n5 / 5 = 1\n\n2,400 = 2^5 * 3 * 5^22	Does anyone know why summer colds seem to be much harder to shake off than winter ones?

Do you agree ? \nRead who is RELIGIOUSLYS persecuting who (Al Quaida vs USA)\n\n-----\n"Some people believe that both the United States and Al Qaida are involved in religious persecution. The September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States have been suspected by religious figures of happening because of America's relative secularity; though, it should be noted that Al Qaida never once in their public statements used that as a justification for 9/11 or any other attack. The reasons Al Qaida give for their attacks are the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia, the cradle of Islam, which they consider sacrilege and occupation of Muslim territory, and the support by the United States of Israel. Christian churches have been bombed in Pakistan and there have been attempted attacks on churches elsewhere..."  \n\nFinish reading this in Wikipedia before commenting... i agree. it confirms what i have gathered here and there in news or articles about relegious percecutions. \nit is really sums up the situation here. \n\n   As far as stand of muslim terrorist organization about US presence in muslim countries is concerned it may be right upto some extent. but it does not condone their world wide activities. their own government is also responsible for the US presence. they need to look there and start cleaning up their system. \n\n  the terrorist organization have become a buissness. most of the recruits are jobless youth who not only get money(collected in the name of islam by thier rich brothers) for this world and promise of heaven if dead. then they go out , kill innocents , work as mersinaries of muslim countries in countries like india. we have even hindu(ULFA) and communist terrorist organization funded by anti indian countries.\n\nthe BIG talk about justice for islam is a sham in such incidents. how can ethnic cleansing of hindus from kashmeer can or otherwise innocent deaths are going to improve conditions in saudi arab. why if muslims are in majority in a small area they start asking for free islamic country but when in minority they want others to be secular?\n\ni am not happy with the situation and really have not much idea as how to change it while keeping  a ballace; so that it does not turn into percecution nor the guilty could slip by.\n\nAs I scrolled to other pages such as hinduism i know it to be accurate first hand.-----\n\n" The Persecution of Hindus has existed throughout history. ..in Bangladesh ..from the partition of India in 1947 until today. Hindus who initially ... 30% of the population there have now dwindled to around 10%. Almost all of those driven out are now refugees in the North Eastern states in India. This ethnic cleansing has gone largely unnoticed by the rest of the world.\n\n...report documents the long history of anti-Hindu atrocities in Bangladesh..... including targeted attacks against temples, open theft of Hindu property, and rape of young Hindu women and enticements to convert to Islam, have increased sharply in recent years ...\n\nBut that is only the latest chapter ....estimated loss of 20 million Bangladeshi Hindus is because of an ongoing genocide and forced exodus.... \n\nHindus in  Pakistan have declined from 23 % of the total population in 1947 to less than 2% today.........state-sponsored religious discrimination against Hindus through bigoted "anti-blasphemy" laws.. millions of Hindus being held as "bonded laborers" ...in rural Pakistan, something repeatedly ignored by the Pakistani government. Pakistan aggressively portrays its struggle against India as a Hindu-Muslim conflict, making it clear that its own Hindu minority is fair game for persecution.\n\nEven within India, the pattern is the same. The combination of Pakistani-sponsored violence and local anti-Hindu sentiment has led to a similar "religious cleansing" of the Kashmir valley, where almost all the Hindus have fled.\n\nMuch like the Bangladeshi Hindu refugees in India, the Kashmiri Hindus are an unpalatable subject for many Indians, an ideological embarrassment for some people who feel uneasy about discussing the persecution of Hindus by Muslims. ... ignoring the campaign launched by various Muslim groups to use public threats and violence, including murder, to terrify the local Hindus into leaving.\n\nSome Indians ... do not want to be reminded about the problems of Hindus outside their milieu. And for some in the Indian intelligentsia, it is a badge of honour to distance themselves from these pogroms as a mark of their supposed enlightenment, oddly trashing their own ethos in the process. Many more Indians are reluctant to speak out against atrocities committed against Hindus for fear of being labeled "communal". Merely speaking about human rights for Hindus is for them a form of communalism.\n\n........

(all examples) This  is the FIFA rule regarding your question. This rule came into force on 1 January 2004.\n\nUp his 21st birthday, a player who has represented an Association team (Country) in one or more matches of an official competition may henceforth request to change the Association for which he is eligible, provided that he fulfils the following criteria:\n\n- he has not played at “A” international level for the Association for which he is eligible at the time he submitted the request;- he had dual nationality (or more than two nationalities), at the time of his first appearance in an international match in an official competition of any category. Therefore, this provision does not apply to any players who have been naturalised after having already represented one Association. Consequently, FIFA has rejected the request submitted by Murat Mogomedov, a Russian player but now a naturalised Israeli, as he has already played for Russia.\n\nAny player who fulfils the above criteria may only once request to change the Association for which he is eligible.0	do you like the da vinci code? novels like?\nnot really.think it's worth reading? yes.\nAs a work of fiction and not fact.9	Who is right in BJP-Kerala among Mr.K.Ramanpillai and Mr.P.P.Mukundan?

Dust is also responsible for the pinkish sky on\nMars, as seen in the photographs returned from the Viking landers.\n\nIf the atmosphere contains lots of dust, the direct light from the Sun\nor Moon may occasionally get some quite unusual color. Sometimes,\ngreen and blue moons have been reported. These phenomena are quite\nrare though---they happen only "once in a blue moon...." :) The dust\nresponsible for these unusual color phenomena is most often volcanic\nin origin. When El Chicon erupted in 1982, this caused unusually\nstrongly colored sunsets in equatorial areas for more than one year.\nThe much bigger volcanic explosion at Krakatoa, some 110 years ago,\ncaused green and blue moons worldwide for a few years.\n\nOne possible exception to the above discussion is if the clouds on the\nplanet are composed of a strongly colored chemical. This might occur\non Jupiter, where the clouds are thought to contain sulfur, phosphorus,\nand/or various organic chemicals.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the light of the planet's primary is\nquite insignificant. Our eyes are highly adaptable to the dominating\nillumination and perceive it as "white," within a quite wide range of\npossible colors. During daytime, we perceive the light from the Sun\n(6000 K) as white, and at night we perceive the light from our\nincandescent lamps (2800 K, like a late, cool M star) as white. Only\nif we put these two lights side-by-side, at comparable intensities,\nwill we perceive a clear color difference.\n\nIf the Sun was a hot star (say of spectral type B), it's likely we\nstill would perceive its light as "white" and the sky's color as blue2	who  first described albinism?

There are many different kinds of privacy which we may or may not have a right to: right to protect personal data, right to privacy in personal decisions, and so forth. Which, if any, do we really have a right to? all the above.4	where can I find a free program for converting MOV and/or AVI to VOB?  9	ww1 info on 58 squadron?

I am sick of feeling like its only selfish people and people who cheat and take shortcuts are the only ones who get anywhere.  I feel like I am a good person, but yet it gets me no where.  I just want to be happy and surround myself with positive people, but there doesn't seem to be many people like this out there.  Where are they hiding??? I feel the same way!

Since i am an employee myself, i got that part down pretty well.) From an employers prospective, I think it would be cost they are looking at. They have to pay a temp to do your job  or have someone take on your job that works there for the time that you are away. Production for the time would be low and a money loss, either by paying a new temp or the guy who has to do your job and his.  Employers are not threatened by you taking the time, in fact, a lot of employers know there are life issues that need to be delt with.8	Bad idea to date a cop? I met a cop through a good friend.

My great advice will be this: Learn HTML. If you use other ready programmes they will either interfere your website, or they will put their ads in your website and you will never be sure what's going on in your website. Your age is great you should learn how to write web script yourself. When you start to understand what's going on sky is the limit. Here is one of the best ways:\n1.Go to "www.learnem.com"\n2.At the bottom of the page you will see this ad:\n  "Web Design in 7 days"\n3.Click the "click here" for download and you will be directed Cnet downloads site where you can read comments about this e-book, and also you can download it for free.\n4.Once you finish download follow the instructions, open the programme. It can be opened by Adobe Acrobat Reader (you probably have on your computer, if not you can download it for free). \n5. Follow the instructions in the programme. Because it is Adobe text, you can not cheat by copy and paste, you will have to write your programs yourself.\nI'm sure you will learn how to create your own website, and you will enjoy it.\n Best luck7	Any good websites to check out beside answers?  http://www.homestarrunner.com - just go check it out\n\nhttp://www.keaton-world.com - one creative kid\n\nhttp://www.albinoblacksheep.com - loads of funny vids and stuff\n\nhttp://www.dmusic.com - really cool user-based music site\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com - movie/tv database\n\nhttp://trent.blogspot.com/ - really funny blog\n\nThose are just a few that I like to check out from time to time.7	where can I find Schubert's "Ave Maria" sung in Italian, and the Italian lyrics too?

There are many versions of Ave Maria, be sure it's Schubert. If you need anything else e-mail me Klm4k8@umkc.edu. And you can try iTunes or classical CD of Schubert. :O)9	What is the food like on a Navy ship?  On Canadian ships, we are very, very well fed.  \n\nFor one thing, our ships only have one galley for the Captain, the Wardroom, the Chiefs and PO's and the Junior Ranks.  So quality is really on the high side of things.\n\nAs for quantity, we can't complain.  0300 and 0700 breakfasts, 1000 soup, lunch, dinner, late meal around midnight, always toast, cereals, fresh fruit and very often leftovers available round the clock, and more kinds of condiments than we can shake a stick at.  And of course, we have the "regular" dishes.  Sunday is Prime Rib night, Thursday is Steak Night, Friday features clam chowder made from scratch as the soup of the day, with Fish and Chips for lunch (from scratch, too) and pizza for supper.  Lunch features a sandwich counter as well.  And at every meal, there are 2 main choices, plus a pasta choice and a vegetarian choice, so no matter what, you're pretty much sure to find something you'll like.\n\nWhile our cooks don't use much in the way of spices, they use a lot of herbs and even without using anything, it's pretty good.1	Biology Question.....?

I understand that the U. S. has a large amount of oil shale in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and is planning to develop it into petroleum products.  What companies will develop this oil shale? http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9143/index1.html\n\nUnderstand that all the oil companies in this country are foaming at the lips to develop shale oil.  Even conservative estimates put the amount we have at 100% of our need for hundreds of years.  Shale oil is NOT a poor source of oil.  Indeed, we get about 20% of our oil from canadian shale oil, and they have FAR less than we do.  Our shale oil reserves are FAR greater than all the oil in the middle east combined.  It would take less than a year to convert to 100% shale oil and cost far less for that oil than we are currently paying, even considering in the development costs of the first year (after that, it's far cheaper to maintain it).\n\nThe only thing standing in the way is Congress.\n\nAlso, understand this.  We do not have to convert over to 100% domestic supply (although it would be a good idea to have the capability to rapidly do so by vastly increasing our refinery capabilities).  All we would need to do is maybe supply an extra 25% of our own needs.  That would crash the oil market and break the back of the terrorist funding middle east.  The ability to slide our oil import consumption up and down would give us an incredibly potent weapon to use against these jackasses and force them to behave.6	Are your mortage points usually listed on your 1098?

I just broke up with my boyfriend today and it was a horrible situation...and i'm heartbroken. I just wanted to know if anyone else is out there feeling the same pain.... This is a hard situation on all accounts, and I know how you feel, because I was the one that initiated the divorce.\nYou are feeling like a failure that you gave up because you took the initiative in the breakup.\nYou feel stupid because you did not want to face the cause of the breakup until it happened, and you feel you have lost time.\nYou feel the hurt, because of the emotional investment that has been lost.\n\nBut, know this.  You know it was a horrible situation.  If there was ever a doubt in your mind regarding anything, you did the brave thing and took the initiative.  The pain is bad, yes, but remember, every rose has thorn, every joy of birth has it's pain of labor, every day off earned at work is sweat on your brown.\n\nThis, too, shall pass, but in the meantime, play the radio, crank it loud, and rent the goofiest guy-bashing movie you can find.\n\nGood luck!3	what was the cold war? i need cold war information for a project at school give me all you got.

According to Jeff Nightbyrd, there is testing industry data that taking 4 aspirins a few hours prior to the test might help you. ". . . aspirin interferes with the Syvia [sic] EMIT assay. It seems that aspirin absorbs at the same wavelength that NAD does which is how it interferes with the assay" (Clin Chem 34 (90) 602-606). Two reliable sources have tested aspirin and found it to interfere with the EMIT. In the future they will try to find a way to circumvent this test flaw. Until then, I certainly recommend taking advantage of the situation and using aspirin1	What is the most important theorem that has not been prooved?  Actually, Fermat's last Theorem has been proved in 1993 by a mathematician named Andrew Wiles.\n\nAs far as the question goes, it ain't a theorem if it hasn't been proved ;)\n\nBut my favorite conjecture is Goldbach's conjecture, which states that any even number over 2 can be written as a sum of two primes (14 = 3 + 11, for example). No one's found a counterexample, but no one's proved it either.4	Finally found the web hosting i needed or do you recommend something else? finally i founded the web hosting i needed at nikaksa.net or do you recommend something else?

Lately I feel like I have been going in the wrong direction and I am not sure which way to go. I recently read that if you are feeling depressed then part of it could be that you are not following your path and need to get back on it. My problem is that I have never really known my path and now would like to find it so that I can get on with what I am supposed to be doing while I am here this time. Not sure why I ran across your question, but it's a good one. For a clear path, we all need a dream and a vision. \n\nAre you a Christian? Definitely pray. Seek and you will find. He will give you the desires of your heart. \n\nBasics for tonight and tomorrow . . . Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Also, find a non-denominational Bible-based community church. Go tomorrow. God will meet you there.\n\nI really loved "Your Best Life Now" by Joel Osteen. This book offers a lot of hope and gives a thinking outside of the box perspective.\n\nA great book for purpose and path . . . "The Purpose-Driven Life" by Rick Warren. He guides and gives perspective in this book. Remember, it's not about you. It's about what you can give. (Take care of yourself, though!)\n\nI heard Bruce Wilkinson speak last year . . . he had a book called THE DREAM GIVER. He also wrote the Prayer of Jabez. He can motivate anyone to find their dream. It's inside you already.\n\nI heard Matthew Barnett speak last month about how he started The Dream Center in L.A. to help people of all kinds turn their lives around. He said once you start serving, you won't want to be served again.\n\nAnother great teacher on vision and leadership is John Maxwell. He has books on leadership that include "vision casting" and building a team. Check out www.injoy.com\n\nYou are on the right path if you are seeking your path! God bless you and keep you and make His face to shine upon you and give you peace.7	I am looking for a sign/poster that says "I believe there are angels living on earth dressed to look like peop I either want a sign/picture that already states this or want to find a bracelet it could be engraved on.

Function Overloading: This means having 2 or more functions in the same locality with same names but different NUMBER or TYPES of parameters.\n\nEX:\nvoid SetAString(const char* val) {m_someString = val;}\nvoid SetAString(const std::string& val) {m_someString = val;}\netc..\nthe functions are distiguinished based on the parameters.\n\nFunction Overriding: Two functions are said to be overidden  when they share the same name and/or even the same parameters(Number and Type) but are part of diff classes, one of which is inhereted from other.\n\nEx:\nclass B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, "HELLO", NULL, MB_OK);}\n\n}\n\n\nclass A : public class B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, "NO", NULL, MB_OK);}\n}\n\nthe result of calling SaySomething depends on the subtype of\nthe object\n\nIn short: Overloading is a method that allows defining multiple member functions with the same name but different signatures. The compiler will pick the correct function based on the signature. Overriding is a method that allows the derived class to redefine the behavior of member functions which the derived class inherits from a base class. The signatures of both base class member function and derived class member function are the same; however, the implementation and, therefore, the behavior will differ.5	what is the contact number for ANYONE at yahoo ???

I no what i think he has done wrong, but the real facts Im uncertain of. So here it is there has been no war crimes, If saving a country  from a mad man who has slaughtered his own people with chemical weapons is a crime then what is helping humanity. Most of the civilian losses in the war are from the ignorance of the people- they stand outside during a firefight watching the battle (common sense says not to due that). \n\nLets see rebuilding schools, hospitals, power plants, water purification sites. Yea real war crimes there.\n\nMedical attention to the population- another war crime in the making.\n\nGee if only the media would tell the People of the the World the real truth instead of the half truths that sell.\n\nIf anyone should be held responsible for war crimes it should be the media - just ask the 200 detainees who were killed because of the detainee abuse coverage- insurgent bombed a prison in Iraq as retaliation there's your war crimes.1	Using conceptual physics to support religon? My beliefs are pretty much a mix of methodism/deism/quantum physics, and i believe that your perception of the world, its gods, and your ideas about the afterlife and the state of the universe will determine what you percieve as your afterlife.  In quantum physics, time does not exist.  Also, in order to exist, something must be observed.  As time does not exist, and the perception of time is simply our minds viewing the different probabilities the world may exist in.  Therefore, all people are both alive and dead.  In order to observe ourselves and observe others, we must exist.  As something cannot both exist and not exist, only change form or be transfered between dimensions, the sentience that inhabits our bodies must persist after death for us to observe our lives, as both life and death occur simultaniously according to this worldview.  \n\nTherefore, there must be something beyond death.\n\nYour thoughts? Nice ideas, but do they keep you up at night? I prefere to think of life as something that may not last, so I go ahead and enjoy it as much as possible. If there is an afterlife, yippee. If not, then I've spent the time I had well. I sleep well at night.7	why can't we move our heads 360 degree?  i dont know i wish we could that would be fun and look freaky lol5	World Cup???(hard core fans only)?

He has no body, nor shape, that is why He has no creator. Male and female concept has come because in English or any Western language due to teachings of the Bible there is a tendency to refer God as He which is wrong. The fact that it is a mistake is realized very recently when a letter has been circulated from the Pope that all the prayers are to be corrected and God should never be referred as a male or He. Hindus are very clear since the days of Vedanta and the Veda i.e. at least 30,000 years or before that God has no physical body and His manifestation is the Nature which is visible and the invisible part is much much bigger, the ever expanding Universe.8	How can i find some friends on the web...Who lives nearby??? how Can i find my perfect match...On the net....They should live nearby.....If i put a question on Yahoo!Answer It gets Deleated And no one will respond in Yahoo!Group.....Wher else can i chat and find my match Hey!

Here you go ....\n\n"For seventeen years Annie Oakley was the Wild West Show's star attraction with her marvelous shooting feats. At 90 feet Annie could shoot a dime tossed in midair. In one day with a .22 rifle she shot 4,472 of 5,000 glass balls tossed in midair. With the thin edge of a playing card facing her at 90 feet, Annie could hit the card and puncture it with with five or six more shots as it settled to the ground. It was from this that free tickets with holes punched in them came to be called "Annie Oakleys." \n\nThese links will help.  Best of luck with your report.8	THere's this guy...?

Before you bash the question, I just want to say that I'm not trying to be immature like some people are when asking things like this. I'm really just looking for sincere answers. Not, "how dare you ask, people are people" or some empty statement like that.\n\nI ask because from what I've observed living my whole life here, that pretty white girls seem to have an easier time overall. They're never lonely, they can always find a handsome boyfriend. There's always girls who want to be them so they hang out and be their friend. They usually have many strong friendships with other girls who look, sound, & act like them. They have strong support by other women, women of power. Getting jobs is easy if their somewhat smart as well as beautiful. Because of feminism, people seem to listen to most everything they say or have an issue about. They're beauty is all over the media which boosts their confidence dramatically. Many seem more happier than men, & girls of minority groups.\n\nThoughts? Oh please, a girl just has to look at a guys penis to be called a whore.  Regardless of color. Men can sleep with hundreds of girls and be praised and respected, regardless of color. And last I checked men still get paid far more than a woman with the same qualifications in the work force. You have an extremely limited world view and experience. Go live a little...your statements are BEGGING for some sort of evidence or even explanation to back up your claims.\n\n"Getting jobs is easy if their somewhat smart as well as beautiful."\n\nHow does this translate into a an easy life?  You are foolish to think that all girls, white, black, whatever...are pleased to get a job  only because they are somewhat smart. You are foolish and frustrating, even if you are sincere in your question. Sorry to be rude.\n\n\n***WELL, asker, quite frankly I took offense to your question and your following details which seem to prove that you do believe this misperception to be true.  At least I apologized.\n\nAnd the point of my frustration toward your question is that you think it makes life easier to get a job based on beauty....how degrading. Most of us go to school to get a degree in hopes that our qualifications ONLY will be considered. If you want to be a pretty white girl who gets a job because she is beautiful, oh and can also spell her name,  just to be gawked at and not taken seriously...then by all means, be my guest.  \n\nI too have seen girls get jobs based on their beauty and then i have also seen how everyone talks behind their backs about how stupid and useless they are.  Doesn't really sound easy to me...\n\nFurthermore, I have also seen pretty Mexican, Black, and Asian girls get jobs b/c they were Mexican, Black, and Asian. Its called affirmative action.\n\nI find it incredibly odd that you dont believe that women are paid less across the board, yet you do think that women get jobs because they are pretty and white. First of all, hiring women because they are beautiful while their qualifications are obviously disregarded, immediately puts her in a position to be ignored and shoved to the side because she was hired to look good and keep her mouth shut.  Now do you honestly think that the man who hired her just to look at her is going to pay her the same amount as the men he hired with identical qualifications, if not less. \n\n\nYes there is a progressive drive to decrease the gap and improve equality but it is far from over. Im not arguing for women's rights, Im just saying that every single statement you made was jaded, because you have no idea about anyone's life but your own.\n\nAlthough I do not feel the need to prove anything to you, especially since you obviously have access to the largest provider of knowledge known to man, you can take a look at this website for a little bit of info about the salary gap which happened to be compiled THIS YEAR.\n\nhttp://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/pay/pay_facts.htm8	i need help ......? i find it difficult to trust my friends what do you think i should Talk to them about it.7	what is the book in the lake house that kate(bullock)'s dad wrote? is it called persuasion? i can't find it. kate loved that book and it was the one that she left behind when she was leaving. i think it's called persuasion or something but i can't find it. does someone know the book? is it a real book? i need the real title and author. can someone please help me?

I've heard and read some things about the photon belt, but none of it is conclusive. Some sources say that the extreme concentration of photon energy will disrupt all electrical devices on Earth and some sources say it will push Earth into an estheric (spelling?) dimension. Other sources say that it will take the Earth 2000 years to move through this belt and then other sources say that we have already entered the photon belt. Other sources are just ridiculous. To be honest, I still don't know what the photon belt is exactly and whether it holds any implications for life on Earth at all. How big is this belt and how did it form? How long will it last and has the Earth ever passed through it before? If so, how long does one cycle last? I need someone to really dumb this down for me; like a "Photon belt for dummies" book. No rocket science please. There is no such THING as the PHOTON BELT. In fact it is actually a theory. The only thing like that is a solar flare from the sun. Photons are particles of light and energy and wouldn't effect anything on Earth.\nPS, the photon belt is actually a band of energy from the sun, ie, although it is theoretical I still know a bit about it although it is very little. The sun gives off solar flares but theoretically it gives off a rounded wave or a blast wave that slows down and this band is invisible and orbits around the sun. It isn't actually to do with photons, it is to do with energy although it is on the electromagnetic light spectrum. It contains electrons but is relative to and is related to plasma and energy physics this effects the Earth the same way as a solar flare does so the "solar wave" or the so called "photon belt" physically a belief of when all equipment went and goes down.\nI beleve there isn't one but we are always make up theories and beliefs of things to understand anomalies.4	Where can I get study materials for PMP certifications? 1.

As cells differentiate, certain genes are silenced.  This silencing is done by modifying the histones (a sort of protein spool about which DNA is wrapped) and making the DNA rather bunched up, and inaccessible to the transcrition factors and promoters that activate a gene.  The totipotent cell requires that none of its genes are thus silenced, while cells with a silenced gene will see the same silencing in its daughter cells.9	Can anyone please tell me the REAL reason why our US troops are still over in Iraq??

Nanotechnology comprises technological developments on the nanometer scale, usually 0.1 to 100 nm. (One nanometer equals one thousandth of a micrometre or one millionth of a millimetre.) The term has sometimes been applied to microscopic technology. \nNanotechnology is any technology which exploits phenomena and structures that can only occur at the nanometer scale, which is the scale of single atoms and small molecules. The following are the applications: \ncancer treatments that reallywork, clean energy, clear water, a restored environment, the key tospace exploration, future jobs, and new manufacturing capabilities. Nanosize" powder particles (a few nanometres in diameter, also called nano-particles) are potentially important in ceramics, powder metallurgy, the achievement of uniform nanoporosity, and similar applications.5	Palermo going to sell Andrea Barzagli to Juventus?

I look up at the Moon from my home in Scotland and see it as it has always looked to people here, in the Northern Hemisphere. But if I was in the Southern Hemisphere and looked at the Moon, would it look the same, or Upside Down.\nI guess the same question could be asked in reverse by someone "Down Under" :-D As the moon is round, I think even if it is upside down, we won't notice it. Because a circle remains a circle whether looked from up, down, right or left.\nAlso the moon is completely white. If it was different colours we would have known whether it was upside down .ie. by looking at the colour's position.\n\nIt is a very puzzling question! I answered what I think. I am not sure whether my theory is right or wrong.\nGood question! You made me rack my brains really hard :)3	Why do clocks run Clockwise?  Note that the direction of the written language has nothing whatsoever\n   to do with the way clocks run.\n   \n   The clock is a mechanical timepiece modeled on its predecessor, the\n   sundial. North of the Tropic of Cancer, the sun affects the sundial in\n   the following way:\n     * Sun rises in the east: shadow falls in the west.\n     * Sun, at noon, is south: shadow falls in the north.\n     * Sun sets in the west: shadow falls in the east.\n       \n   The shadow moves in a W to N to E rotation, which is what we call\n   "clockwise." When mechanical clocks were invented, this rotation was\n   duplicated. Regardless of the direction of your written language, the\n   clock hands move the wrong way half the time!\n   \n   South of the Tropic of Capricorn, a sundial moves counter-clockwise,\n   and between the tropics, the motion of the shadow depends on the time\n   of year. Had the clock been an invention of South American Indians or\n   Southern Africans, "clockwise" would likely mean the opposite\n   rotation.5	what 3 schools have the largest student enrollment that are playing in the NCAA men's basketball tournament??

If you don't know about this, look it up.  The cost of underground fencing was not figured in to the budget allocations so when it comes up don't be surprised.  Ask yourself is it less expensive to build a fence above ground or below ground where you have to trench through lots of solid rock? As I understand it the fence will have trenching on each side.  This is primarily to prevent cars from ramming the fence, however, it will also make tunneling more difficult.  In addition there will be sensors and unmanned drone aircraft and thousands more border patrol officers. This may not catch every drug lord tunnel, since they spend a ton of money on those, but it will make it a lot more expensive for illegal immigrants to effectively tunnel.\n\nAlso, to the extent illegal immigrants have to go through a tunnel, we have won.  That would mean they were slowed to bottlenecks.  In that case the flow would be nothing like the levels we have seen over the last two decades.5	does anybody know?

Reducing air pollution (NO2 and SO2 emissions in particularly) will help prevent acid rain.\n\nAcid rain refers to rain which contained Nitric acid (HNO3) and/or Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in it, hence its name.\nWhen Nitrogen Dioxide gas (NO2) and Sulfur Dioxide gas (SO2) dissolve in water, they form very strong and corrosive acids.  These two gasses are minor byproducts of the combustion of fossil fuels due to impurities in the fuel.  When these gasses dissolve in rain water, the rain becomes acetic and can damage things on the ground.\n\nReducing air pollution is a major step in preventing acid rain.7	i'm bored does anyone know any fun games ont eh computer and theri web sites? please i could die!!!!!!!!

With george bush's speech today, does it do any help for me as an international student to get a citizenship? if yes , how? please let me know, thx. I think it may help you, some. Apparently, government policy has limited green card or permanent status for foreign citizens who wish to work full-time in the United States. Hopefully, the issue of Mexican illegals will provide some relaxation in these restrictions. If you are here on a student visa, you'll have to apply first for permanent status and meet those requirements, which include an offer for a job that is one needed in the U.S. But I think your chances will be better now than before, as the issue of immigration in general has been raised in the arena of politics, not just as bureaucratic governing.7	If I eat enough beans, can I fly to the moon?

If you think you're good enough to get recruited, go to the schools athletic websites and most schools will offer a "Prospective Student Athlete Form" to fill out, where you put things like how strong you are, your speed, etc. \nOnce you get to a school, get in contact with the athletic department, asking them when walk-on tryouts are. Be relentless. \nWhat schools are you looking into?8	how can i change my feeling about life and about love......pls every body answer me ?? i have some feeling in my heart so bad about life....but there is no proplime's with any body .....but all time i looking to love and i see i missed to love....but i wan't any one tell me how can i do to make happy to my life and change my bad feeling?

I think Tom Cruise is a huge part of the reason. He has pushed his profile, beliefs, money, power and self righteous judgements onto the world so profusely that people in general are not wanting to hear, see or support anything connected to him. I have not seen the movie, however the majority of people I have heard that have are far from excited with it. So word of mouth would have an effect om whether others choose to see it. Personally I'm going to give it one huge miss. I don't like his acting anymore than his personality. I think his biggest fan is himself.9	What would you do if you were a president ? Each of us has a dream : to be a star, to be rich, to visit many countries, and it was said : 'all is possible'\nFrench proverb I would pare down the Government.  Our government in the 60's used to represent 2% of the GDP, now it's 40%.  \n\nThomas Jefferson was very clear about the government staying out of the way of commerce and acting to protect our borders.  Let's move back to that successful strategy.1	what is the derivation of the two point formula?  For the equation of a line?\n\nSlope is change in y divided by change in x, so subtract y coordinates and x coordinates of the given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2): (y1-y2)/(x1-x2).  \n\nSlope on a line is constant, so if (x,y) is ANY point on the line, then the slope between it and a known point is the same as the slope between 2 known points, so\n\n(y-y1)/(x-x1) = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)\n\nFinally, move the x term over to the right side:\n\n(y-y1) = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2) * (x-x1)5	Hey, I think I'm learning alot from these two?

There are MANY reasons, I can't really list all of them but here are a few. \n\nFirst off it depends on what type of bridge is needed. Some types can span longer distances but cost more to design and build while others are cheaper but can't reach as far.\n\nAlso, different materials have very different properties. Depending on what is needed Structural Engineers will choosee different materials. Steel for example is very strong in both tension AND compression, however it needs to be kept in good condition weights a lot and also may be hard to build with in some circumstances. Concrete for example has very strong compressive strength and very low tensile strength. This means that while concrete can stand a lot of pressure, if you pull on it, it can crack somewhat easily compared to other materials. Cost of these materials also play a factor.\n\nFor bridges steel and concrete are not the only materials used. I've seen some glass ones, ones made of stone, wood... a lot of different materials. Before you even get into other materials though there are MANY types of concrete and steel to begin with.7	What's the best song by T.

Basically it's when you have a guy dip his b*lls(like you dip a tea bag) in a girls mouth.1	What is the basis for the Fahrenheit scale? Zero Celsius means water freezes; zero Kelvin means zero molecular activity – what does zero Fahrenheit mean? ere are several competing versions of the story of how Fahrenheit came to devise his temperature scale. One states that Fahrenheit established the zero (0 °F) and 100 °F points on his scale by recording the lowest outdoor temperatures he could measure, and his own body temperature. He took as his zero point the lowest temperature he measured in the harsh winter of 1708 through 1709 in his home town of Gdańsk (Danzig) (−17.8 °C). (He was later able to reach this temperature under laboratory conditions using a mixture of ice, ammonium chloride and water.) Fahrenheit wanted to avoid the negative temperatures which Ole Rømer's scale had produced in everyday use. Fahrenheit fixed his own body temperature as 100 °F (normal body temperature is closer to 98.6 °F, suggesting that Fahrenheit was suffering a fever when he conducted his experiments or that his thermometer was not very accurate), and divided his original scale into twelve divisions; later dividing each of these into 8 equal subdivisions produced a scale of 96 degrees. Fahrenheit noted that his scale placed the freezing point of water at 32 °F and the boiling point at 212 °F, a neat 180 degrees apart.7	Has anyone had sex on The Bachelor?

Will I have just the green card and/or I'll become a US citizen as well? You can apply for a green card as soon as you're legally married to a US citizen.  It can take anywhere from a couple months to a couple years to get approved depending on your location and the circumstances.\n\nOnce you get your green card you're a conditional permanent resident but not a US citizen.  You have to apply two years later for non-conditional permanent residency.  At any point during this process you can be revoked if you're no longer married.  You generally are not subject to revocation if you are the victim of spousal abuse.\n\nUS citizenship is separate and you can generally apply after seven years of legal residency.6	Do u believe in ghosts?r they 4 real?

Some of the causes of a high BUN level:\n\nA high BUN value can indicate kidney injury or disease. Damage can be caused by a variety of conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that directly affect the kidneys. In addition to direct damage to the kidneys, high BUN levels can be caused by blockage of the urinary tract (by an object such as a kidney stone or tumor) or reduced blood flow to the kidneys caused by dehydration or heart failure. \n\nA high BUN can be caused by medications, such as allopurinol (Alloprin), aminoglycosides (Garamycin), furosemide (Lasix), indomethacin (Indocin), methotrexate (MTX), aspirin, amphotericin B, carbamazepine (Tegretol), vancomycin (Vancocin), propranolol (Inderal), rifampin (Rifadin), spironolactone (Aldactone), tetracyclines, thiazide diuretics, and triamterene (Dyrenium). \n\nA high BUN value may also be caused by a high-protein diet, Addison's disease, tissue damage (such as from severe burns), or from bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nA rise in BUN can indicate kidney problems caused by diabetes. \n\nHigh BUN-to-creatinine ratios occur with sudden (acute) kidney failure, which may be caused by conditions such as shock or severe dehydration. An obstruction in the urinary tract (such as from a kidney stone) can cause an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio. A very high BUN-to-creatinine ratio may be caused by bleeding in the digestive tract or respiratory tract.1	Which country sent the first man into space?  The Soviet Union, in 1961.

Does God manage more than one property? Explain why or why not. Over the centuries in many cultures there have often been sightings, drawings and abductions. What do you think? Is there a connection? If God is a construct of how mankind views a supreme existence, and UFO's are a construct of how we percieve the existence of life outside the boundaries of the known realm which we know life exists; then why wouldn't they both exist simultaneously.\n  You're correct that there have been many depictions in a variety of cultures throughout man's recorded presence upon Earth, but what man calls God, has also had a multitude of names and faces.\n\n If God exists, and he created mankind, and mankind has created the machines which we use daily to travel across our planet, to the moon, and beyond. It seems to be that  other beings which God, or perhaps another God that 'manages other property' would also create machines which would accomplish similar tasks.\n\nMaybe the Universe itself is God, and we are just a singular cell of a mighty living organism.0	What if I want to pay the penalty for my own sin? not jesus?

I have read that the Tigers will need more left handed hitters next year and that Barry Bonds would be a great fit, because he's patient and him and Jim Leyland go way back , plus he would put more asses in the seats. He's not my favorite player, but I can't understand why anyone wouldn't want Barry Bonds on their team.  Even playing with the effects of injury last season (and possibly the loss of steroids), he still hit 26 homers and had a better on-base percentage than any current Tigers player.\n\nCalling him a loser because he's never won a World Series makes no sense, either.  When the Giants made it there in 2002, Bonds hit .471 with 4 homers and an amazing .700 OBP, so he's hardly to blame for not winning a title.  If anything, he should be given credit for turning some poor Giants teams into competitive outfits over the past couple of seasons.\n\nAnd as for being a poor teammate, it's not like his surliness should hurt anyone.  Sure, he might be a jerk, but baseball is also the least "team" among team sports, since 90% of the game is the duel between pitcher and hitter.\n\nYou don't have to like Bonds, but to dismiss him is just nonsense.  I'd love to have him on my team because he'd give them a better chance to win, and that's what the game is all about.8	Just a thought for Guys and Gals.? What do you see when you look into the mirror? Do you Love who you are? Do you see everyone as "equals"? Are you one of those people who will only date "skinny" or only "big" people? do you ever find yourself judging even your spouse? I've always had a fascination with people's mind's. I was just wondering. Just had a thought. And I wanted to see what everyone thought of themselves, and everyone around them in the world. I myself. I love who I am. I would like to fix up some things on myself. And with other people, well My husband is a bit big. But his personality is beautiful. Thank you for answering. when i look into the mirror, i see a girl growing into a woman. i love myself, but have doubts in my competence and always feel that there are people better then me, and i want to be them. Everyone is different, there is no equal, the world is brought up see the "ideals", "perfects" i am talking about those on television, magazines.. as much as to me, i feel that never judge the book by its cover. i always believe that inner beauty is the most important, however, it is not proven yet to me by the society. still being pretty, like the ideals is the ideal... but i am not and still willing to search for those who thinks the same as me.\n\nthank for asking..smiles6	Disaster Management Careers??

Several methodologies are used in Main Economic Indicators (MEI) to link time series. The preferred method, and the one most widely used, is the 12-month or 4-quarter link method.  This method can be applied when an old and new series (which are being linked) contain data for an overlapping time period of at least one year.\n\nThe 12-month (4-quarter) link method calculates a linking factor as the average of the first common year of observations of the new series divided by the equivalent observations of the old series.  This method is robust, in particular when revisions have been made with the introduction of the new series.  Also, this method ensures as best as possible that consistency is maintained between raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the same series.  An exception to this procedure is made in the case of Price Indices, where use of the first common period link method is preferred.  This method calculates a linking factor as the ratio of the first observation of the new series to the equivalent observation of the old series in the overlapping period.  This method ensures the same monthly growth rate at the link point for the new and old Price Indices and minimises the impact on the long time series if major changes are made to the coverage of the new Price Index. \n\nUse of the first common period link method can cause a spurious relationship between the raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the new series prior to the link point (i.e. after the link has been made), which is the primary reason why the 12-month link method is preferred for most time series.  However this is not an issue for Price Indices as these are generally not seasonally adjusted.  Where a full common year between old and new series provided by a country does not exist, the first common period link method will be used.  Also, if there has been no revision to the new series over the first common year, these two linking methods yield the same result. The choice of preferred linking method was decided after detailed methodological and empirical study by the OECD Secretariat.\n\nThe implicit link method is used to link series which share no explicit overlapping period, but for which a common reference period can be established by inference or deduction.  For example, the method could use the information that for the two series, a common base year value is 100. The two series can then be re-referenced to this common base year and then concatenated (i.e. joined).  Note that the information set which necessitates using this link method is rarely found in practice so its use is infrequent.\n\nSome series expressed in levels (such as monetary series measured in currency and series covering western and later unified Germany) are joined by concatenation. This means that values of the new series replace or are added to the old series from the first observation of the new series. As a result of its construction, this method may produce one or more significant ruptures (i.e. series breaks) in the linked series at the link point(s). However, such ruptures are documented in the publications and the database.\n\nMain Economic Indicators investigates each series on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they should be linked or not. If they should, then the most appropriate method is determined by in-depth analysis. Series with little in common methodologically, or those that exhibit significant differences in their evolution are not linked. Furthermore, different methods may be used for different links within the same series, depending on the nature of the old and new data series being linked at the particular point in time.  In general it is the policy of the MEI to try and maintain long time series, and therefore our preference is to link series wherever possible and provide appropriate metadata to users.4	how do i connect java and sql?? i need to use a database in the backend and java in the front end.. how do i link these two?? what lang should i learn for this??

In a six-team league, take Pujols. In a 12+ team, you might want to grab the best player at a somewhat difficult position to fill in ARod.7	will naruto be the sixth hokage???

The Egyptians believed that preserving the body in death was important to keep their soul alive.  The Embalmers were priests who were trained in the mummification process.  Mummification was a ritual, so the priests who participated were trained to perform the process with both surgical and ritual precision.  The embalmers were required to work and labor outside of the town in a workshop called a “Wabet” or a clean place.\n\nThe head priest that supervised the ritual wore a terra-cotta mask in the form of Anubis.  Anubis was the chosen god for surgeons, and for priests performing the mummification process.  By wearing the mask of Anubis it symbolized Anubis watching over the mummification process to guide the priests in the ritual.  It was important that the priest did not make any unnecessary cuts in the body, because if the spirit could not recognize the body it would be doomed to wonder across the Earth and possibly haunt the priest responsible.\n\nThe first step in the process was to make a cut in the abdomen, below the ribs, on the left side of the body.  This first incision was done with a special flint knife, and all other cutting was done with an ordinary metal blade.  They had to cut into the body so that they could take out special organs.  Once the organs were removed they were placed in canopic jars, which were carved out of alabaster and inscribed with spells that would one day enable the organs to rejoin the body when it was resurrected.  The organs that were placed in the jars include: stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver.  Once inside the canopic jars each organ was protected by the one of sons of Horus whose head graced the lid.\n\nNext the brain would be extracted through the nose and then thrown away.  Resin was then poured through the nose and into the skull with the use of a funnel, to keep the head from collapsing.  The heart was left in place because later in the underworld Anubis would weigh the heart and guide the soul through the underworld.  During the embalming process every part of the body was saved and either placed in the tomb with the body or given to the relatives of the deceased.  Then, the body and organs were preserved with spices and dried out with natron salt.  The spices that were used in the preservation process made the body look brown and leathery.\n\nThe entire preservation process took about 70 days.  After the process was complete, the body was wrapped in linen.  Death masks were placed on the head of the mummy around the bandages to be used as a replacement head incase something happened to the real skull. Special amulets were placed within the wrapping of the mummy to protect it.  Finally, a “mummy tag,” similar to our toe tags, was placed around the mummy’s neck to help identify it for burial.3	discuss the teaching strategies to teach a grammar point at the upper primary level?

From the different documentaries, I have seen and the article from National Geographic, I'm inclined to conclude that Sheba was a territory in the South-West of the Arabian Penisula in an area that is now around the Yemen and Saudi Arabian border area. There was discussion of a lost city covered by sand dunes in this area, recently discovered by satellite imagery. The archeologists are now studying these ruins. I think that may be the key to Sheba. Hope this is of help.\n\nTo Arabs, Sheba was Bilqis, a queen of the incense-rich lands of ancient Saba in what is now Yemen. \n\nEarthly Queen \n\nScholars believe that if there were an actual Queen of Sheba and she did visit King Solomon, it would have happened about 950 B.C. \n\nEarly research dated Saba back to 650 B.C. By the time Clapp began his search for the historical queen, however, archaeologists had used carbon-14 dating to show that Saba had an alphabet, and thus civilization, that dated back to 1200 B.C. \nBut it was in Yemen where Clapp came closest to the object of his pursuit. Using space images and a device for global positioning system navigation, Clapp conspired with drivers dazed by qat (a narcotic leaf) to follow an ancient caravan route leading to ruins where Sheba's tomb may lie. \n\n"With that civilization now coming into focus, the biblical account of Sheba and Solomon assumes the marking of a real event and by association gives Solomon credibility as a historical figure," Clapp notes in his book. \n\nBibical Queen Revised \n\nThe Yemeni ruins of Ma'rib and Sirwah indicate that the Sabeans were an advanced civilization with characteristics that match legends about Sheba, said Clapp. The sites also allow for an archaeological interpretation of I Kings 10:1-13. \n\nAccording to Clapp, Sheba was probably a powerful merchant queen of Saba who capitalized on the domestication of the camel to open trade routes to the Fertile Crescent Israel, Damascus, Sidon, and Tyre. \n\nIn this interpretation, her visit to King Solomon, a hill country chieftain, was a high-powered trade meeting. \n\nThe "difficult questions" Sheba asks Solomon in their biblical meeting may have centered on long-range trade, said Clapp. And the gifts she is said to have given to Solomon "a hundred and twenty talents of gold and great quantities of spices and precious stones" are commodities for distribution. \n\nIn turn, Solomon gave Sheba "all she expressed a wish for." Clapp says that in mercantile terms, that wish might have been for passage to the lucrative markets of the Fertile Crescent. The phrase also raises the possibility of an affair of the heart, giving greater credence to the myth of Menelik. \n\nExcavation of the Ma'rib and Sirwah sites is ongoing. "Will there be a day when the Queen of Sheba's tomb is discovered?" Clapp asks. "[The civilization] went on for 1,800 years, not one of their tombs have been found yet. There is a huge trove of discovery to come." \n\nFrom the second link:\n\nSheba (from the English transcription of the Hebrew name sh'va, also Saba, Arabic: سبأ) is a southern kingdom mentioned in the Jewish scriptures (Old Testament) and the Qur'an. The actual location of the historical kingdom is disputed between Ethiopia and Yemen. In the Old Testament genealogy of the nations (Genesis 10:7), Sheba, along with Dedan, is listed as one of the descendents of Noah's son Ham (i.e. son of Raamah son of Cush son of Ham). In Genesis 25:3, Sheba and Dedan are listed as sons of Jokshan. Another Sheba is listed in the Genesis 10 genealogy as a descendent of Noah's son Shem, i.e. a Semite. (There the genealogy lists Sheba as son of Joktan son of Eber son of Shelah son of Arphaxad son of Shem.) The nation makes its first appearance in world literature in the form of the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis, in Islamic tradition), who travels to Jerusalem to check out the fame of King Solomon (1 King2	How can I get rid of hick-ups?

If you want to have a pleasant experience in dealing with a 'bulk lot' of machines for web browsing you really want to get something that can run XP Pro.\n\nIf you are going to try and keep ME/98/95 etc secure for web browsing you have a lot more work to do than if you are running XP Pro.\n\nWith XP Pro you can administer the machines as part of a network and you have access to the far better security tools that Microsoft put into XP and the tools that others supply for XP. With anything before XP you have to know what you are doing and have to be prepared to put in the work to keep them secure etc. Can be done but life's too short in my opinion.\n\nSo the summary is the minimum specs you should be looking at, in my opinion are the minimum specs for XP Pro which are here\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/upgrading/sysreqs.mspx\n\n///2	What is the difference between angina and ischemia?  angina means chest pain -- however not all chest pain correlate to heart problems. \nischemia -- is lost of blood supply to the heart muscle, therefore this causes a pain in that certain are. myocardial ischemia, if untreated will eventually turn into myocardial infarction -- where in the muscle dies because of lack of blood supply and oxygen.4	how can I make a web site free with yahoo for my bussines?

So I was pulled over today by a police officer, he said he checked my plates and they went back to my last car that I traded in towards this new car. So basically my plates didn't match the car I was driving, but the registration is under my name and I own both cars, so it's not like a stolen plate/car. I'm not hurting anyone, except for myself. He didn't give me a citation on the spot. He said he was going to mail it, and he wouldn't tell me how much of a ticket I'd be getting. Anyone know? It's not like a drunk driving ticket or something extreme, so I hope it doesn't hurt my wallet. If it helps I'm in the state of Pennsylvania.

Do you think his punishment is too harsh or it's just appropriate that people like him should not be anywhere near any people or objects, or beer?  Should this man be locked away from society for good?  Keep in mind this wasn't his first run-in with the law or acting like as an idiot.  But do you think he should worry though, because if he finds an Asian girl, she will love him a long, long time.  She will take all his bullshits and she will pay for everything he wants too!

I have been asking this question for many many years.  My belief in a higher power is there, but I am not sure that I would say that there is a creater of heaven and earth, as the heavens is the universe and earth was born of the sun.  No one has been able to logically answer this question.  Look at the universe, it has a beginning (the big bang or whatever people believe) and an end (possibly as no one can be sure).  Everything is created in some way, and has some sort of death.  Planets are formed and then they die.  Galaxies are created, and then they die eventually.  We are born and then we die.  There is no end to this list.  I have always wondered if there was nothing, and then all of a sudden there was a big bang or something and the universe was created, isn't it true that there should have always been something there to cause this?  If it is a chemical or molecular reaction, where did these come from?  How were they formed?  This question in reality has no answer. You have answered your own question with the last line of the question. Why bother to write all this stuff?7	How do you finger a Pentatonic scale?

Offspring are bred with the same temperament. Average heights are approximately between 28 in. (0.70 m) and 31 in. (0.77 m) in a young horse (2-3 years old). For mature horses, one can expect a height between 30 in. (0.76 m) and 32.5 in. (0.83m). Smaller and bigger horses are exceptional. These minihorses' proportions are in complete harmony."2	Why is my hair faling off like crazy? I have healthy, long hair that is well taking care off, but every time I brush it or wash it... it falls off big time. Am I going bold? Or is this seasonal? Hair loss in women can betransient (synonyms = temporary / telogen effluvium / non-genetic) orpermanent (genetic / androgenetic alopecia). To determine whichcategory you fall under, please read this web page to learn more.\n\nBefore learning about female hair loss, one must understand the human hair growth cycle.\n\nThe average person loses 50-100 hairs a day. Hair loss only occurs when the number of shedding hairs exceeds the number of new hairs coming in. Normal hair growth is a three stage cycle:\n[a] Anagen - Growth Phase Approximately 85% of all hairs arein the growing phase at any one time. The Anagen phase or growth phasecan vary from two to six years. Hair grows approximately 10 cm per yearand any individual hair is unlikely to grow more than one meter long.\n\n[b] Catagen - Transitional phase At the end of theAnagen phase the hairs enters into a Catagen phase which lasts aboutone or two weeks, during the Catagen phase the hair follicle shrinks toabout 1/6 of the normal length. The lower part is destroyed and thedermal papilla breaks away to rest below.\n\n[c] Telogen - Resting Phase The resting phase followsthe catagen phase and normally lasts about 5-6 weeks. During this timethe hair does not grow but stays attached to the follicle while thedermal papilla stays in a resting phase below.\n\nApproximately 10-15 percent of all hairs are in this phase atan one time. At the end of the Telogen phase the hair folliclere-enters the Anagen phase. The dermal papilla and the base of thefollicle join together again and a new hair begins to form. If the oldhair has not already been shed the new hair pushes the old one out andthe growth cycle starts all over again. Each hair passes through thephases independent of the neighboring hairs.6	How much money would you need monthly to live comfortably?  That is tricky.  It would depend on your location and how you are used to living.  I support my family of 3, a dog and a cat on $1500 a month.  That doesn't leave a lot of room for extras, but we do go out once in a while.  We have everything that we want, but we must budget for large purchases.0	need to talk to people who have experienced an incubus or succubus or sleep paralysis.?  I'm not ratting on pagan religion, I'm speaking from a psychological perspective here.  All three are sleep paralysis.  It is a problem with the physiology of the brain during sleep.  It's caused by an inactive pons, an area in the brain stem, during periods of post-sleep where it should be inactive.  The pons is responsible for paralyzing your muscles when you sleep as to prevent you from acting out your dreams.  When it is inactive as you awake, you can't move.  It can be quite frightening because your breathing rate is suppressed and it sometimes feels like there is someone pressing down on your body.  That's where the myth of the incubus/succubus comes from.\n\nScott, you're full of it.  no offense.  That's such a primitive way to characterize a sleep/brain disorder.7	why doesnt ne body like michaeljackson.i mean he is great and why do people say so many mean things about him. plze stop Michael Jackson used to be a decent pop star.  But, as with many celebrities, their 'screen' persona is completely different from the person underneath.  Michael Jackson, as a person, is insecure and has strange obsessive desires and behaviors.  Michael Jackson, as a pop star, is a decent musician and knows how to put together good pop music.\n\nThe reality is, you have to be willing to distinguish the pop-star persona of MJ from the real person that is MJ.  There are basically two different people: the MJ on we see on stage and in videos (a persona created by the music industry) and the MJ in real life who dangles babies, hangs out with children and is obsessed with plastic surgery.1	does any body know any magic tricks. if you know some how do you do them.?  get a thin metal washer, tie a long string on to it and put it on a table and put a table cloth over it, put a marble in the center of the washer (washer under cloth, marble on top of cloth)  and during the act use your magic wand to move the marble (your assitant that the people don't see will be pullin the string moving the washer which the  marble is sitting in so it looks like the marble moves on it own8	Is she a real friend? She says she's trying to hook me up with my crush, but she's flirting and he likes her now. My advice is that If you have to ask, she probably isn't.

Yes, you can filter a bunch of mail addresses to one folder with one filter. But for this the bunch your are willing to redirect must have some similarity.

Yes  water is adhesive due to polarity. The question was resolved and best answer chosen,1	if i was traveling in a vehicle at the speed of light and turned on the headlights would they work?  No. well, its absolutely impossible to travel at or faster then the speed of light, but lets pretend you can so i can actually give you an answer to the question. The speed of light is actually the ultimate speed limit to the universe, nothing can travel faster than light, so although you would expect the light to be going at twice the speed of light (you plus the speed of light)it can't because it is physically impossible for even light to travel faster than the speed of light so it would be going slower than you and not reach any path in front of you. Of course, if you turned on your headlights before you started moving, the light would be one step ahead of you.\n\nOf course, still, nothing can go faster then the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation(time slows down for an object moving close to the speed of light) t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) where t' is the time passing for an outside observer, t is the time that passes for the object going at the high velocity, v is velocity, speed is the speed of light and ^2 is squared. (note: this formula is definately correct, it's part of einstein's theory of relativity and I've had to derive it myself for class in the past) so if v was bigger than c, you would have a number greater than one and therefore a negative number under a square root, which is impossible.4	How do I switch Javascript on (Adobe Flash Player)?

Dry skin\nDry skin is common; as skin loses moisture the surface cracks. \n\nThe inherited forms of dry skin are known as ‘ichthyosis’ (fish-scale skin). There are various kinds of ichthyosis. Dermatologists often call dry skin arising in later life ‘xerosis’, ‘asteatosis’ or ‘acquired ichthyosis’. \n\nThe dry areas may result in dermatitis, i.e. the skin becomes red and itchy. This may result in a crazy-paving appearance on the lower legs (‘eczema craquelé’), or round patches scattered over the trunk and limbs (a dry form of nummular dermatitis). Sometimes the dry skin is just itchy, without much of a rash (sometimes known as ‘winter itch’, ‘7th age itch’, or ‘senile pruritus’). \n\n \nIchthyosis   \nClose-up of ichthyosis   \nDermatitis from dry skin  \n\nCauses of dry skin\nFactors which contribute to dry and cracked skin include: \n\nInherited factors \nMetabolic factors such as an underactive thyroid gland, or excessive weight loss. \nIncreasing age, resulting in decreased natural lubrication. \nCool weather, especially when windy or the humidity is low. \nAir conditioning, central heating or sitting close to a fire or fan heater. \nExcessive bathing, showering or swimming, especially in strongly chlorinated hot or cold water. \nContact with soap, detergents and solvents. \nFrictional irritation and chapping. \nTreatment of dry skin\nAn important aspect of treatment is to identify and tackle any contributing factors (see the list of causes above). \n\nReduce how often you bath or shower, and use lukewarm water. Showers may be better than baths. \nReplace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, etc. \nApply an emollient liberally and often, particularly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. \nTreat eczematous patches with a topical steroid for a 5 to 15 day course. These are prescribed by your doctor and should be only applied to the red and itchy areas. \nLong term control\nDry skin is usually a long term and recurring problem, especially in winter. When you notice your skin getting dry, resume your lubricating routine and use a non-soap cleanser. If the itchy dry-skin rash returns, use both the lubricating routine and the prescription steroid cream or ointment. \n\nso now u can work out what u got...so is the treatment...\n\nis it usfull...if not pls contact me..\n\nget well\ngood luck2	Guys only please?

What's the best telescope for the money? GoTo is mandatory. My children are small, so I want to be able to find celestial objects quickly (hence GoTo is mandatory). \n\nI don't need to view terrestial objects. I do want great clarity and be able to see at least major bodies (Jupiter, Saturn's rings, Moon, etc.) in our solar system.\n\nMy budget is under $200.\n\nI've looked at these two: \nMeade's Jupiter DS114-EC #40114RE\nhttp://www.meade4m.com/4mshop/40114RE.html\n\nJupiter DS114AT-RE #40114AT-RE\nhttp://www.meade4m.com/4mshop/40114ATRE.html\n\nThank you for your answers in advance! Either one is just fine but if you're only going to be looking at the moon and solar system objects (e.i. the planets), you probably don't need the Go To feature. Everything in the solar system is bright and easy to find.. The Go To is only needed for finding dim objects. I would consider giving up the Go To for  better optics. The eye pieces with these scopes are small. Standard eyepieces are 1 1/4 inch these are .96 " so they'll be tougher to look through. Do you have a college/science center that has an astronomy club ??

All this talk about "troops fighting to protect freedom" doesn't really wash given the sycophantic loyalism that many people appear to have to the government regime's strategies.\n\nAre americans so brain-washed that they are self-censoring? It is, in my opinion, the true patriotic duty of every American to question our leaders, voice our objections, and hold our elected representatives accountable.

My boyfriend and I got in a fight, and the charges against him are serious felonies, including kidnapping, assault, aggravated burglury, and menacing.  I made a statement of what happened to the police and they decided on what the charges should be.  I was not aware of how serious these things were and how much time he could get in prison.  Since he's been in jail, i have reconsidered my statement and would like him to be released. he has not gone to court yet, but the prosecutor told me there is nothing i can do until we go to court.  I dont know what to do in the mean time to help get him released and work on dropping the charges.  I have written another statement to the prosecutor describing my changed feelings, but i do not want the court to think that i lied to them in any way.  I do not want to incriminate myself. The truth is that whether you drop the charges or not, the prosecutor still makes the ultimate decision whether or not the state wants to press charges.  This may be totally out of your hands...particularly if he committed some of these offenses against others.  Even if you don't want to testify, if you get subpoenaed, you better show up and whatever you do, do not perjure yourself!3	what is the past tense of word analysis?  analysis would not be changed to past tense.

The Pentium 4 tops out at 3.8GHz, the Pentium D tops out at 3.46GHz but the Pentium D is dual core and 64-bit.\n\nThe fastest AMD processor on the market is the Athlon FX-60 64-bit dual core processor which tops out at 2.8GHz but unlike the Intel Pentium D the Athlon FX-60 has two full 64-bit cores operating at 2.8GHz.  The Intel Pentium D on the other hand is composed of two 32-bit cores with a bridge to act as a 64-bit processor.  The AMD chip in a word crushes Intel.\n\nSo to answer your question THE FASTEST consumer processor at this moment is the Athlon 64 FX-60.\n\nCheck out the benchmarks at Tomshardware, http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/11/21/the_mother_of_all_cpu_charts_2005/page24.html1	optimization problem? find two numbers whose difference is 100 and whose product is a minimum 100,05	if your fishing on a lake that has no fish are you still fishing?

Essential Fatty Acids! Look for a supplement with Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with Borage Oil or something similar. Happens alot when people drastically reduce calories. Make sure you still eat 3 meals and at least 1-2 small snacks a day. Also, don't stick with any diet too long that takes certain foods out of your diet. Moderation not starvation is key. Hair loss may be your indication that you are not eating enough. But check with purchasing EFA's anyway. Any drug store, GNC, Wal-Mart should have them.8	British boyfriend I really want to marry? I've been with my boyfriend since February 1st, 2003 and we want to finally be together forever. We met online so since then we've been going to each other's countries on tourist visas and staying the entire length of it, which gets difficult and expensive... and hard to hold down steady jobs. I just can't figure anything out, you can't just go get married because it doesn't count, right? What can we do? I'm American, and it doesn't matter whose country we live in, we just want to be together. It's not a quickie wedding to gain a green card, it's really love. It would be best if we got married in U.K. (Wales) because of his career. I'd also like information on how to get my pets there. 3 cats and a Rottweiler... my Rottweiler is also listed as a dangerous dog because of some liars, it's completely untrue but would that cause problems? Anyone with answers to either of these questions PLEASE help me. Especially about marriage. Thanks so much in advance, I'm heartbroken about this. Well, pretty much all you have to do is obtain a marriage license to get married in England. You don't have to be a citizen, but you still need the valid license.

How'd she react? \n\nWomen: Has your man (or woman,if your les) actually said yes to you? If you are,would you want him to admit it or are you simply looking to know your still sexy to him? I've asked my husband, and he was honest. I've gained some weight since I've been stationed here and he said that I have "some chub" I said straight out, no I'm FAT. (10lbs is a lot for someone as small as me. Eventhought no one else in the world will tell me I'm fat. My family and friends all think I'm crazy, but I do have chub on my belly. I'm so glad he's honest) but I think guys should always always be honest. I want him to tell me I'm fat so it'll motivate me to go to the gym more. Or have him tell me to have less unhealthy foods when we eat. It's helpful. It's embarrasing, but don't punish him for your own mistake!\n\nToo many women get so sensitive about being fat, but the truth is, YOU PROBABLY ARE FAT! so don't get mad if someone says you are. The average Amerian is overweight. Being fat is gross. If your man can tell you that you are overweight or say you could do with losing a few pounds, you should love him more for being honest.

Palindrome Geoff is right about how to arrive at the root he described, however, that is not the whole story.\n\nJust as there are TWO numbers that satisfy the meaning of √16 (that is, 4 and -4) there are actually FOUR numbers that satisfy the meaning of √(√(-16)):\n● √2 + i√2\n● -√2 + i√2\n● √2 - i√2\n● -√2 - i√2\n\nGeoff's analysis about "turning the angle halfway" toward the positive x axis is a good intuitive way of understanding what is going on. However, what he left out is that it DOESN'T MATTER which direction you turn, clockwise or counter-clockwise. Both directions are equally valid and both should be taken into account.\n\nFor √(-16), turning clockwise gives you 4i, counter-clockwise gives you -4i\n\nFor √(4i), turning clockwise gives you √2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you -√2 - i√2 (remember, you are going halfway to the positive x axis the long way)\n\nFor √(-4i), turning clockwise gives you -√2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you √2 - i√22	If I don't eat much to save money, is it still anorexia?

Say if every time you go to a family gathering for the holidays and they treated you differently than everyone else and treated you like crap and they always ruined the occassion for you because of their constant insulting remarks that you had to leave because they hurt your feelings so bad, would you still invite them to your wedding?  This is the most important day to you and you want the day to be special and you want nothing to ruin it but you know that if you invited everyone then that is exactly what will happen.  If you don't invite them, they might get hurt and then it will be on your mind all day.  What should you do in a situation like this? The POLITE thing to do is to INVITE Them to the wedding.

Would you like it more if instead of a solo artist backed up by a beat machine, they were in a band backed up by a bassist, drummer, and guitarist(Rage Against The Machine, Faith No More). Or if they rapped about better subjects(politics, poverty, oppression). good point, r.a.t.m were brilliant and the rap lyrics worked very well so i guess you might be right about rap, less [c]rap and more rage type music.6	I'm new to the modeling scene, does anyone have any good advice for me? I don't want to be trampled over by people who think they know what's best for me. And I want to keep my head above the influence that people have by thinking that you have to be throw up a lot or on cocaine to keep up skinny weight. I'm not even skinny! I have been doing this thing off and on. It's hard to get in with the right agency. One that's not going to make you look trashy. Work hard, and don't compromise. Don't smoke; it takes years off your face. Take care of yourself as in exercise and eating right. Keep your hair and nails in shape at all times. Wear sunscreen everyday. The sun is bad for your skin. Use foundation with an SPF of at least 15 in it. Keep your skin moisturized. Oh yea, if your not skinny most of them will not even look at you. Even if your not fat they'll tell you that you can be a plus size model. But don't be discouraged. Work is work as long as it's not nasty work. Know what I mean.5	L´équipe de France en 2010?

I calculate that the spacecraft would have to stay at least 1.3 million miles of the sun's surface because of the extreme heat. Just how hot is the sun? Besides, why study the sun up close? The European Space Agency already has a satellite orbiting the sun called the SOHO craft.  It is much more distant than you describe but its images are spectacular.  Many comet chasers use the website to discover new comets orbiting our sun.  Just do a search for SOHO and ESA and you will find the site.5	Who do you think will win the game: Ecuador vs Germany??

We can not afford to keep our motor home - we owe more than it is worth - we need to know what the penalties would be to turn it back to the lendor - we would pay the difference in what they could sell it for and what we still owe on it.  We do not want to stiff the lendor just get rid of the motor home.  How do we do this?  We do not want to end up with bad credit. We do not know the steps to take to do this. Anyone out there that has gone thru the same thing?  We would appreciate any advice. You don't want to turn it over to the lender.  It will be a repossession and it will still be a negative impact on your credit rating.  Your lender doesn't want it either.\n\nYour best option would be to try to sell it.  Call your lender and let them know you can't afford it.  See if they'll work with you by suspending your payments for a month or two while you try to sell it.\n\nGood luck!9	why westran media want to spread hatrid against islam & PROPHET MOHAMMAD PEACE BE UPON HIM, IS THIS CLASH OF .

Dear anna1\n\n1)Definitively to have a legel court hearing - even in closed session because of the nature of the crime. Totalitarian governments usually either have no legal hearings or just sham sessions with the obvious outcome decided beforehand.\n\n2)If found guilty, investigate the motivation: \naa)Idealism (fanaticism) for the State, e.g., Freedom of the Press, \nab)against the State, e.g., "Jihad" (Arab: holy war); \nba)For personal material gain only, e.g., money paid for the information, be it the informant (or his family), \nbb) No personal material gain - idealism only.\n\n3)Let the punishment fit the crime. For \naaa+bb) first offence, showing remorse and understanding of the consequences being harmful to the State and signing a Declaration of Renunciation (never to do it again), "conditional" <10 year's imprisonment, set free,\naab) furter offences, <10 years imprisonment; \nab+bb)>10 years prison and/or enclosed psychiatery; \nba) >15 years (during war time: execution within 48 hours).5	Should zone defenses be banned to allow more scoring and to make the game more faster paced?  i like the concept of zone much more then man. it forces the players to practice and get better on their outside game. \n\nit also makes it harder for each team to get offensive and deffensive rebounds since all of the people in the paint at once. otherwise, having a really big guy like yao or shaq wouldn't really matter cuz it would just be like a one on one. too easy, more people fightin for the ball make the game more exciting. \n\nplus, if everyone had to go to man, the excellent pointgaurds in the league would have no trouble getting past their deffender and that would tempt them to be more of a ballhog. while talking about ballhogs and zone, zone asks for more passes then man and that usually helps a team get more open looks outide\n\nso overall, i would stick with zone, it has been working pretty good so far.8	Anyone know a good dating coach or therapists and counselors for dating?

Bj and the bear- B.J. McCay was a good-looking young trucker who traveled around the country in his big red & white rig, with a single companion - his pet chimp, Bear. B.J. was based in rural Georgia and was confronted by a succession of corrupt local sheriffs - Elroy P. Lobo (who was later given his own series, Lobo); Sgt. Wiley of Winslow County and his two fellow lawmen, Sheriffs Cain and Masters. The only honest cop B.J. seemed to encounter was the Fox, who spent much of her time trying to trap the crooked local cops. Tommy was a lady trucker friend and Bullets ran the local hangout, the Country Comfort Truck Stop.In 1981, B.J. settled down to run a trucking business in Los Angeles called Bear Enterprises. His new adversary was Rutherford T. Grant, a corrupt politician who headed the state Special Crimes Action Team. Grant was a silent partner in   TransCal, the largest trucking firm in California and stopped at nothing to stomp out potential competition. Because of Grant's intervention, B.J. found it impossible to get regular truck drivers to work for him and had to settle for a crew of 7 young, beautiful lady truckers, including a pair of identical twins and Grant's daughter, Cindy.\n   Hello Larry-Following the breakup of his marriage, radio talk-show host Larry Alder moved from Los Angeles to Portland, to get a fresh start. He got a job at a radio station KLOW, where Morgan Winslow became the producer for his phone talk show. Earl was Larry's obese engineer. Lary had been given custody of his two daughters, 13-year old Ruthie and 16-year old Diane. Glib and in total control of the air, he was much less sure of himself at home as the single parent of two maturing girls. Leona, a school teacher and neighbor, tried to bring a little of woman's touch to this chaotic household. Larry's ex-wife Marion ( Shelley Fabares) also turned up occasionally. Added to the regular cast in the fall of were former Harlem Globetrotters basketball star Meadowlark Lemon, playing himself as a owner of a sporting goods store, and Tommy, a 14-year old neighbor. In February 1980 Larry's retired father, Henry, also moved in.\n Yes, you can by them5	How can i shoot better? when i am just shooting i can shoot good, but when i am in a game miss them.?  act like you are alone and there is no one else there at the game at like you are just shooting at your house5	Can you imagine Kevin Garnett joining Tim Duncan and the Spurs?

Women all over the world are crying out, "I don't like what I see. I want my clothing back! I want my dignity, honor, and mystique restored. I want to push away fear. I want to be empowered and free!" How did we move so far from the hope and promise of lasting loving relationships and have accepted a jaded and cynical view of relationships? It was the women's liberation movement.  Now women are denying their emotions all for causal sex and claiming they are happy in those relationships.   Women were never emotionally prepared or created to jump from one man's bed into another.   Women seem to think this has put them on the same level as a man in sexual freedom.  The men are excited because now they are relieved from any obligation, responsibilities and developing maturity in a relationship. They can have their cake and eat it too.  We as women need to demand more from men.   If we do not encourage them to be in a responsible relationship they will never commit. \n  I know there are those that claim they are happy and I have had a few friends claim the same.  The truth is that it tears down a woman's self-esteem and she gets to the point that she beleives she is not worthy of a good relationship so she settles for second best....an occassion rump in the hay with whomever.  \n\nOh yeah, then you have the good women who know how to treat a man and have a good stable relationship and we meet the men who have been with these "sexual liberated" woman and they expect the same from us. \n\nIt is no wonder the men are so irresponsible and take relationship so causally.8	I need to get some action this weekend!!

There could be three possible reasons why your sound card no longer works.  Assuming you had sound before, it could be the sound card itself, the speakers or the driver that makes the sound card work.  \nThe speakers are the easiest to get off the list.  Get a pair of headphones and plug them in "input" jack on your sound card.  If you hear sound, then it's your speakers, check to insure they are turned on and the wire isn't broken.\nNext is the driver.  If you are running Windows XP you can go to the device manager and see if windows thinks the sound card is working, if not use the windows hardware wizard to see if windows can sort things out and that also include the updated driver.\nLast is your sound card might be dead.  Well first check to insure it is still seated into the mother board if you have a plug in sound card, but you might have a sound card built into your motherboard and with that, you might need to disable your built in card and get a replacement plug in card.2	what is a legal substitute for hydrocodone? something that has similar effects lorcet,darvaset ,lortab ,oxycontin , morphine,8	my little brother is coming from south carolina and every summer we fight how can i prevent this from happenin  lock him in the closet this time.5	Did anyone put a bet for seahawks?  no they suck5	can you watch live nba games on the computer?

Every fraternity's rituals are different. That story is probably one fraternity's ritual. Other rituals may include stripping down to your boxers and enduring harassment of your peers, stealing University property to add it to the fraternity house. Its all different, just college guys doing stupid stuff. \n I'm not quite sure what your main question is though. \nTo join a fraternity at a college you must be attending that college, however I don't think its required that you live on campus or be a resident.

Like is it possible they might be telling me something else is wrong? I am experiencing a blinding sensation in one or both eyes, but I can still see...it's almost like my eyes are wrapped in alumnium foil. It's kind of strange so I don't know how to explain it. I've also experienced some some pain in my eyes and slight pain in my head but right along with the symptoms not after them as what used to happen and it's not anything close to a migraine feeling. Can anyone help me out with this I don't want my doc to think I'm crazy when I try to explain this to him. Sounds about right.  Same thing has been happening to me this year.  Just be glad it's not a full migrain.  Migrains are mental and your brain is finding ways to counteract the migrain before it develops.  You may also be finding ways to react to it differently.\nHere are some things I do.\n1. Take 2 motrin as soon as I see it with my eyes (sometimes I can feel it come on before my eyes go wacky).\n2. Relax\n3. Walk around to get blood flowing if you've been sitting\n4. Use the restroom, eat something soft like a burito, massage sore muscles, or anything else I can tell that may be causing internal stress\n5. Rest your eyes\n6. Get a damp washcloth put on your eyes / forehead\n7. Lay down in bed\n8. If migraine still coming on, I take another 2 motrin at about 1/2 hr after step 1.  Then I go back to bed and its a waiting game from there.5	Will the Lakers lose in the first round of the playoffs?

Do you claim to say that you've met a majority of these people, and can verify that each is an idiot? That would imply that at the very minimum you have met 15,000 Spurs fans, and have been struck by their idiocy.\n\nI think the asker has pre-existing bias against Spurs, and should be examined for the Arsenal-virus in his blood, and held in quarantine till he responds to treatment ;-)4	Which free email service is the best? i want to fix a permanent email id (which is available free) Until the new Yahoo! mail comes out of beta -- or at least the beta goes public -- the easiest to use is Google mail.  It also gives you the most storage (more than 2.5 GB).\n\nThat said, the new Yahoo! mail is said to be more like Outlook than Google is, and the current Yahoo! mail is pretty good, so if you're used to Outlook you should probably consider getting a Yahoo! account and waiting for the new version.\n\nOf course, you can always sign up for both, and try them both out -- perhaps by signing each one up for a few mailing lists.1	what is the most beautiful animal to you and why?  bald eagle cause it flys beautiful and sits with pride4	remove branding?

I wish I could elaberate on this, but I can't think of an example right off the top of my head right now. For some reason nobody gives me a changes and wants to take the time to know all the facts first. Oh! Here is an example! - This subject comes up without fail no matter what I do: I'll say to the man or woman/friend/boyfriend or whoever that I do not drive and they'll ask me why and I'll say that it's because I am vissually impaired and they'll automatically say "well why can't you just get glasses or get lazer surgery". Well, my eyesite can not be corrected like magic. I have perminant eye damage. Take it or leave it. ...Oh shoot, sorry, I'm just frustrated and am wurried that I am doomed if tha is going to be the topic with everyone I mean. I perfer not to talk about it and try not to bring it up and dodge it etc, but nothing works. Any thoughts?...There are other things that I wish I could dodge around too. Not just my eyesite. You know people do assume things about a person, when they\nfirst look at them. If they have time to get to know you\nthey will learn the real you. And you are worth getting to\nknow! I am sorry about your eye sight. I will have to have\nsurgery on my eye when a growth gets to a certain size and I am not looking forward to it. I will have faith that all\nwill be well.  I really think wading through is better than\ndodging problems. When that's done it is resolved instead of put off. The best of luck.2	Anyone older out there depressed about getting older? I feel so young inside, but on the outside I feel likie Gloria Graham in Sunset Boulevard.  Tomorrow I am going to get Botox, all my friends have, and they look great.  My life is so perfect except for this "old" thing.  Has anyone lived life and not realized the years have passed by and wake up one day wondering what happened?  I don't want to be young, I just want the outside to match the inside! It's not the physical age so much. I just turned 40. It's been  real bummer actually. I felt I should be much farther in life than I am. I also feel the clock ticking louder than ever. I don't want to live to be 80 at least the way most 80 year olds live. 70 is probably older than I want or have any realistic hope of achieving. I grew up fast and grew up hard. Most did not think I'd make it to 18. When I made it to 21 I realized things had to change if I wanted to see 25 and I decided I did. So by the time I was 25 I quit using drugs, quit doing the kinds of things that should have gotten me killed long ago and started working on the things I wanted to do in my life before I was done. \n\n15 years later I havn't achived very many of those things. I've made progress. I've come close on some things. I havn't done what I set out to do. I lived my youth like I'd never live to see 40 and it's taken it's toll. Drinking, smoking, drugs, work in hazardous environments and injuries. It makes me a cancer and other disease magnet. How many years do I really have left? \n\nThat of course assumes a semi doesn't broadside me 10 years from now or a bolt of lightning doesn't hit me tomorrow. Whatever the case 40 for me is a time of realizing my mortality. Somehow I always thought I'd live forever and die young. That is I always expected to die because of the life I lived. Then when it didn't happen I felt like nothing could kill me (That doesn't mean I was about to jump off high buildings or something stupid like that :) ) No I am coming to grips with my own mortality and it's frig gin uncomfortable. \n\nThis is strangly at odds with the fact I really don't feel much older mentally or emotionally than I did as a Teen. My back aches, my eyes are starting to go, my knees hurt and various other minor sings of age are creeping in. Still if feels like the party can go on forever yet I know the end is far too close for comfort. I personally am having a hard time reconciling that. \n\nSo yeah I feel something akin to what you feel though I am probably much younger than you right now.6	pick a number between 1 and 10?  4.3215614217651\n\nIt does lie in between!!!!!!!!9	Do you think America has the right to get involved with other countries problems? As an american i feel that we get involved with many countries problems and try to solve them.  I would like to see how other people view this and if they think we have a right to do this or not. I agree that we get ourselves in too many conflicts around the world, but as the only true superpower left in the world, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and as one of the eight (possibly 9 or 10 if North Korea and Iran continue on their course of action) nuclear-capable countries it is the job of the United States to be polic-force of the world. nobody else has the tools to keep the peace. Look at Somalia before Black Hawk Down. We sent in 20,000 US Marines and order was restored. We left the Pakistani army in charge and left the country. All hell broke loose and we had to send the Rangers and Delta Force in to clean up the mess.\n\nIf the United States is not willing to stand up for other countries and be keepers of the peace, no one else will.

Planets spin because the stuff that fell together gravitationally to make them up had angular momentum relative to the planet's axis. If a meteor comes in and hits the Earth, the chances are nearly zero that it will hit head on. A glancing blow will contribute to the Earth's angular momentum. If a planet or star falls together gravitationally from a cloud of matter, even if the cloud has very little rotational motion, the angular speed of spin is increased as the planet or star becomes more compact. This has to do with the conservation of angular momentum, and a typical example is that of a spinning ice skater pulling in his arms to rotate faster. Another example is the water draining in a sink. It almost always swirls around as it goes down the drain, even if there was very little apparent motion to begin with in the water in the sink.7	tell me about my future? my DOB is 3.10.1980, \n\nPlace of birth Firojpur ( PB)\n\nTime of birth 10.30 ( Night)\n\nEvery one tell me that i have the luck of gov job , If it true? OVERVIEW for 2007: \nPisces is having a once in a lifetime opportunity for great changes this year. You will be having the time of your life, expressing your loving and compassion to the world and fulfilling your boldest dreams. There won't be a dull moment and you will intuitively know exactly what path to follow and what feels right in your heart. You will feel compelled to grasp new opportunities that manifest self-transformation in your career. You're stepping into your power easily, especially around April when you are urged to express your visionary mentality. You might rediscover your musical abilities and express yourself in creative ways. You have the power and inspiration to bring mystical sensitivity to what's around you. It's time to bring out the dreamy, loving and compassionate side of yourself and let it shine. You may want to get involved in writing, be it lyrics, poetry or just self reflection. Your idealistic nature is inspired from a strong connection to your surroundings, and you easily express yourself from a place of inner awareness. Your natural ability to communicate ideas to others is keenly perceptive now. Focus on trusting your intuition and you will get through nearly any circumstance. You need to lighten up about difficulties in life. Don't be so critical and overly concerned about details. Because you're so sensitive to others' moods, you may feel like you're not coming across in a very positive way. Take time out and have fun this year. Embrace that intimate love relationship you have!\n\nSample Numerology reading \nMarch 10, 1980\n\nThis Year: 3\nSelf-expression and optimism fill your moments now. The waiting period is over and it's time to jump up and get on with things. Luck is on your side, and you seem to shine with sunny warmth and enthusiasm which draws well-wishers, (and potential benefactors), to you from near and far. Creative pursuits, travel, and communication of every kind is emphasized now. This time can bring an actual "birth", or a figurative one in the form of a new business or career, a work of art or even a new self-image. The important thing is that you use this time of opportunity to the best of your advantage and find new ways to express who you are.\n\nPersonal Day: 3\nSing, dance, make people laugh! Wear yellow or orange. Today you radiate and warm like the sun. Smile and bless us all!\n\nLife Path or Destiny: 22\nThe Destiny number describes the life lessons that we have come here to learn. It reveals to us the path we must take, and the role we must play to fulfill our mission. Often our choice of career is based on this vibration, and if not, then it will manifest through avocational pursuits. We may attract people and experiences into our lives that mirror the traits of this number for us, so that we may develop into our highest potential. We don't always welcome our life lessons, so it is a possibility that we may even feel an aversion to the characteristics of our Destiny number in other people, and we may ourselves act the opposite. In spite of the many ways we may choose to react to this force within us, we have been gifted with all of the talents and energy needed to fulfill our Destiny. This "master number" requires the bearer to dedicate their life to philanthropic aims and service on a world-wide scale. Your destiny gives you the potential to accrue vast wealth, power and greatness through inspired and constructive reformation of social standards. No matter what form your fortune takes, it will be important that it benefits large groups of people in some way. Number 22 is a higher octave of the number 4 and may be experienced as such, or fluctuate during your lifetime.\n\nCycles\nThe destiny is divided into 3 great cycles, each governing us for specific durations throughout our life. The Seed cycle begins at birth and colors our experiences through childhood and adolescence. During the year nearest our8	Why can't I seem to trust him? Well I have left him 2 times in the past.

Many educated people once thought that the earth was flat as in the days of Columbus. The Bible writer Isaiah knew the the earth was round. How did he know that? Because he was informed of that fact by God himself. \nIsaiah 40:22 __"It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in."\n\nThere are way too many Scriptures to prove the accuracy of the Bible. --too many to list here.

I will tell you right now I have the cure for psoriasis and my wife figured it out! I will even send you pics to back it up. Guess yet? Tanning salon...yes I'm serious. My wife had is so bad that it covered 50% of her whole body (she tried everything!!!) and she started going to the tanning salon to build her tan so she could go swimming in the pool come summer and after 3 weeks of going 3 times a week for ten to fifteen minutes at a time you couldn't hardly see it anymore. I was amazed! Now you can't see any trace of it at all. Her mom was the same way. She asked a doctor and said that they use a somewhat similar treatment called light therapy. If your's is the kind that gets a little better in summer (if you go out) then this should help. Don't over do it cause tanning salons can be bad if you do too much and let the employees guide you into builing your tan slowly. My wife is going to be so happy I shared this with you. If it works then look me up and answer one of my current questions at the time with your story.

They are in all the same Order, just different families. There was a program on the Animal Channel about a baby walrous that was abandond by his mother, and was rescued and brought to the zoo. Humans were taking care of him, and teaching him the walrous ways. He was sooo cute. He was a huge creature that just wanted to cuddle, and could have killed his handlers if he cuddled too much, but it was heartbreaking to see how he just wanted to be with others. \nThen they intorduced him to a few grown walruses. The first time he met one of them he was just so joyful and playful and cute... I love walrues ever since I saw that program. Wish I had become a marine biologist.1	WILL YOU ANSWER THIS QUESTION?

I keep wondering why people only base there feelings on religous and moral beliefs and not on what that person feels because last time that i checked we are all humans so we deserve to be able do the things that a heterosexual couples and i think that people should worry more about our rights as humans also Organized Religion is an ingenious way to control  masses of people, collect money from them, make them feel guilt,\nand tell them how to think. Because some people are easily led they do what they are told, no questions asked.They are afraid or don't know how to think for themselves,so they let someone else tell them what and how to think about any particular thing.It's easy to hide behind Religion, easy to hide on a key board and easy let let someone do your thinking for you,because then you cannot be 100% responsible for what you say or believe. So  they take the easy way.The last time I checked THE BIBLE, I read \n"Love Thy Neighbour."\n maybe that is the one sentence they did not read.For some of us who think for ourselves, (yes some of us believe in God ) we do not judge, hate, or say what we are told to. We do worry that gay rights should be in line with the rights other people have and we may not understand all about gay culture but little by little we educate  ourselves by making friends with gay people, reading about gays and asking our gay friends things we don't understand about the gay culture. And because we do these things, our lives are enriched beyond compare to people who don't.2	About a transabdominal ultrasound....?

People without ethics don't care much about your emotions but mostly about their own self-interest and advancement at any cost. Actually most of us are like that in one way or another.

Did you ever need help and went to welfare?  Most of the time, they will give you no help at all. You might need help right away, but told to come back in 2 weeks.  You pay taxes while working, but welfare is not there when you need it. Welfare is financial assistance paid by the government to certain entities or groups of people who are unable to support themselves alone, or are perceived by the government to be able to function more effectively with financial assistance. Some welfare is general, while some are specific and can only be invoked under certain circumstances, such as a scholarship. Welfare can be given to both individuals, or be given to companies or entities, which take place as corporate welfare.\n\nReasons for individuals being unable to support themselves alone might be unemployment, disability, lack of education or some other reason. Assistance may also take form of other relief, such as tax credits for working mothers. Welfare is known by a variety of names in different countries, all with the fundamental purpose of providing an economic or social safety net for disadvantaged members of society. Almost all developed nations provide some kind of safety net of this kind; the governments of those nations where this is especially prominent are known as welfare states.\n\nThe desired outcome and purpose of welfare varies. For individual welfare for the non-disabled, the purpose of welfare often is to provide those who require financial assistance in order to attain a higher income in the first place, especially for those who are perceived to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. The justification for financial assistance to such individuals often cites the requirement for existing financial resources in order to attain tertiary education that would allow individuals to gain more income, and thereby get out of welfare eventually. Welfare for the disabled, in contrast, does not eventually expect non-dependency, and the justification is more philosophical. Welfare may be given to entities as corporate welfare in order to provide capita to industry are perceived by the government to need financial assistance in order to survive or to expand but are thought by the government to be valuable industries eventually and will eventually become non-dependent.\n\nSome of these ideal outcomes and purposes, as well as welfare's effectiveness have been challenged by political lobbies such as those who oppose big government, such as minarchists or libertarians.\n\nPersonal Welfare:\nThe amounts paid to individuals are typically very low, and may fall below the poverty line. Recipients must usually demonstrate a low level of income such as by way of "means testing", or financial hardship, or that they satisfy some other requirement such as childcare responsibilities or disability. Those receiving unemployment benefits may also have to regularly demonstrate that they are periodically searching for employment. Some countries assign specific jobs to recipients who must work in these roles in order for welfare payments to continue. In the United States and Canada, such programs are known as workfare.5	Who was European, African, and World best player the same year? HE is from Africa, and it was during the 90s.

Divide 4 into 20, you get 5.  But that is only half the answer.  The big guy's mass is an anchor for the small guy.  So every time the big guy pulls he just pulling the small guy closer and every time the small guy pulls he is moving closer in a ratio of 3 to 1.  So the big guy only moves 5m and the small guy move 15m.2	what is hepititis C? is this curable?  Hi ferocious\n\nHere are some ideas to heal the condition.\n\nCause\nThe most common cause of hepatitis is a virus that can occur in five potential forms: A, B, C, D, or E. Other causes include excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse (including pharmaceutical drugs, such as acetaminophen), overexposure to chemicals, and, sometimes, as a reaction to properly prescribed medications. \n\nIn recent years, hepatitis C has been on the increase. It is most frequently caused as a result of blood transfusions. Typically, people with hepatitis C are identified either because they have abnormal liver tests or because of a hepatitis C antibody test. A positive test does not necessarily mean serious liver disease, however. People with hepatitis C may have no liver disease, a mild form of chronic hepatitis, or a more serious form of hepatitis that may progress over a number of years to cirrhosis. The usual indications are a positive antibody test for the hepatitis C virus, abnormal liver tests for more than six to twelve months, and a liver biopsy that shows chronic active hepatitis. Approximately 20% of patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus will go on to develop cirrhosis. \n\nNote: Infectious hepatitis can be easily spread two weeks before and one week after jaundice appears. The feces of people with hepatitis contain the virus. Therefore, very strict toilet hygiene and hand and cloth washing should be observed during this time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural Cures\n\nAromatherapy: Rosemary can help stimulate liver function. \n\nDiet: Follow a diet low in protein and high in fresh vegetables to minimize stress on the liver. Also eat small meals throughout the day, and avoid foods such as refined sugars, alcohol, and caffeine, which cause stress on the liver, and be sure to drink plenty of filtered water. Drinking fresh lemon juice water every morning and evening followed by vegetable juice is also recommended to help liver function. Easily digested grains, such as millet, buckwheat, and quinoa, are also good food choices. \n\nEnemas: Three warm enemas administered daily can help boost liver function.\n\nHerbs: The liver-cell regenerative properties of herbs such as milk thistle and licorice can be helpful. Take 1/2 teaspoon of this mixture three times a day. Tumeric combined with milk thistle has also been shown to help alleviate the symptoms of hepatitis B. \n\nHydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments.\n\nJuice Therapy: The following juice combinations can be helpful: beet, carrot, and wheat grass juice; or garlic, burdock, flax, and black currants.\n\nNutritional Supplementation: Supplement with vitamin C, beta carotene, liver glandulars, milk thistle extract, vitamin B complex, adrenal glandulars, lipotropic factors, pantothenic acid, free-form amino acids, betaine hydrochloric acid (HCL), multi-enzymes, and evening primrose oil.\n\nAlternative Professional Care\nIf your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating hepatitis: Ayurveda, Acupuncture, Detoxification Therapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Naturopathic Medicine, and Oxygen Therapy.\n\nbest of health to you4	static header and footer? i do not want my header and footer to reload each time they go on another page of my site. is there anyway I can have those stay and only body portion change. I have about 100 pages and I really want to save users time.... Hi the questions above are so absurd.\n\nYes, I like the way your thinking and it is the correct way of thinking. A static header is always better to have. BUT don't think it will save users time. \n\nWhen you visit a website, the cache is stored on your system, so the page is saved, the photos cached. But there are two ways which you could do what you want. A better way is to leave them static.\n\nIf your using a dynamic scripting language like PHP/ASP/JSP/Etc. Then you can create a header.php and a index.php and a footer.php.\nWithin the index.php you will say include(header.php); and you have your body and then have include(footer.php); That is how every popular website uses. Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/ Myself :)\n\nYou don't have to worry about the header and footer since they don't change. But if you want to just reload the body on each link, then an alternative to frames would be using Javascript.\n\nJavascript has AJAX, then when you click on a link or an area you can tell it to load a portion of the page only.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX\n\nFrames are depreciated for website programming. They are not used for a method like yours. They are used for other instnaces. But in your case it is not good to do it that way. \n\nAJAX is the new buzz word which many people are using. It takes time to learn but it is powerfull. Imagine clicking on a link and only one portion of the page reloads :) That is nice \n\nGood Luck.5	Who is more famous or prestige's Rugby Union or Rugby League?  come on now!this question is getting boring.the last time i answered it ,i had 11 points deducted because i insulted all you league fans.someone went crying to yahoo and reported me.im going to say this again but in a more toned down fashion.OK.i think that league is a boring,softie version of rugby.union is REAL rugby.league is for those who are scared of getting a few bruises and scratches.and for all you league people out there that think union is only for the upper class snobs in this world;try looking a little furthur than your own back yard,to countries like south africa,new zealand,australia and many other places,where rugby is very much the sport of the common man.get your facts straight.7	Is it possible to play ur psp using ur tv as the monitor?

Its a long and costly process unless you have a rich uncle that is gonna give you at least a million.\n\nFirst you need a demo of your item that you have created and tweeked as far as you can.  Then you need to hire an engineer to draw it up in CAD to true dimensions, etc.  Then you need to find a plant that will make the product and have them run a test product for you.  Just this stage alone can cost $30,000-100,000.\n\nOnce you have a true test product then you need to find a testing board and have them test your product to ensure there is a market for it.  Otherwise manufacturers won't want to deal with you as it will be a waste of their time.\n\nOnce you get past all those stages, normally at least a year if this is all you are working on full time, you move onto manufacturers and distributors.  Normally a manufacturer will want to start with at least 100,000 pieces if not more.  They won't do 50 pieces or what not.\n\nPlus during all this you need an attorney to have the item patented, copyright, trademarked or any of them that may apply to it.  Since it is an item that be rode, bike, I am sure a government safety board will have to put their seal on it as well.\n\nThe only way around all of this is to find a local custom fabricator that will make the item for you.  It will cost you more per item this way and you will be able to produce far less items.  A custom guy cannot keep up with a store's inventory let alone going all over the USA.  Plus going this route doesn't stop anyone else from stealing your idea and patenting it themselves blocking you from your very creation.\n\nThe last resort is to get at least a copyright or trademark on the idea/item and have a test demo of the item.  Then approach large companies that are already mass producing bikes and try to sell them on the idea.  Normally this route they will buy your idea from you for a flat fee of like $100,000 to 1/4 million, not much more.  While they make the millions in profit from the idea.\n\nBeing an inventor is just about impossible anymore unless you work for a large company that just takes the ideas you create.9	Anyone know details of "refugee status" in the US and how it works? My boyfriend is from Sudan, and has refugee status in the US because of the war there. He can work and go to school here legally, and he's been here for 3 and a half years. Right now he's on his first trip back home since he came to the states... sort of a family emergency. He should be home in about 6 weeks.\n\nAnyway, what I'm wondering is whether anyone knows the fine details about refugee status. Does it expire? If so, when? How is the time determined? Once you're a refugee, can you eventually be deported if you don't become an actual citizen within a certain amount of time?\n\nI would ask my bf about this stuff, but obviously he isn't here right now. No one I've asked so far has any clue... so maybe someone here will. Here's hoping... ^__^\n\nP.S.  I've asked this before and got people saying he's "on vacation" and "using me."  That's not the case at all; but I'm just stating in advance since I learned from before: I'm not asking for your relationship advice.  That's not the Q? =) According to the information under "refugee" status at the www.uscis.gov site,  a refugee is...\n"Under U.S. law, a refugee is a person who has fled his or her country of origin because of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based upon race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or a membership in a particular social group. If the person is not in the United States, he or she may apply overseas for inclusion within the U.S. refugee program. If the person is already within the United States, he or she may apply for the U.S. asylum program."\nYour boyfriend probably applied for refugee status while living in Kenya as a refugee from the war in Sudan.\n Since it sounds, from your comments, like most of his family is in Kenya and that is where he has spent most of the time, he may very likely not have any changes in his status. Per the USCIS site.....\n"Generally, refugees must be outside their homelands to be eligible for the U.S. refugee program, though the U.S. processes application from refugees in their home countries in a few places. (currently, the U.S. has such programs in Cuba, Vietnam, and the former Soviet Union)."   \nI think that a lot of the Cuban nationals living in the US under refugee or asylum categories, do not naturalize but do live here as legal alien residents. \n.  If your boyfriend has refugee status and also has school and work permits, then he has must also have temporary residency status under the label of refugee. I don't think that acquiring US citizenship is a necessity or requirement. In fact, on that same site, there is a section listing the steps and requirements for an\nAsylee or Refugee Seeking Lawful Permanent Residence (Form I-485). (There is also a processing timetable available.)\n  Also, regarding his ability to travel home for family emergency, \nhe hopefully filed a form I-131 (Application for Travel Document).\nPer the USCIS site, \n"While your I-485 is pending, you are permitted to travel outside the U.S.; however you must have a valid Refugee Travel Document to reenter the country. You can apply for a refugee travel document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. Due to new security procedures, allow 150 days prior to beginning travel to obtain a travel document.

The question is why doesn't your family like her, is it justified. Sometimes we refuse to see things others can because we are blinded by love. I am not a cold person, I am a romantic at heart and I believe that love conquers all but in the same aspect protect YOUR heart in the process by talking with your family about their reasons. And remember they will always be your family, and if their reasons are bogus then marry her because true love is hard to find.9	Why white north-americans dislikes latinos?

I would also suggest working in conjunction with a Pain management Specialist. They are used to dealing with people with severe, chronic pain. They are more understanding of pain and that it strikes people of ALL ages. Many doctors are afraid of prescribing pain medications because the patient might become "addicted" so they are willing to let the patient suffer instead. Be proactive and seek out the doctors you need.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?\n\nThe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis come and go, depending on the degree of tissue inflammation. When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment, and can last weeks, months, or years. During remissions, symptoms of the disease disappear, and patients generally feel well. When the disease becomes active again (relapse), symptoms return. The return of disease activity and symptoms is called a flare. The course of rheumatoid arthritis varies from patient to patient, and periods of flares and remissions are typical.\n\nWhen the disease is active, symptoms can include fatigue, lack of appetite, low grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness. Muscle and joint stiffness are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis).\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, multiple joints are usually inflamed in a symmetrical pattern (both sides of the body affected). The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars can become difficult during flares. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved. Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as gout or joint infection. Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and weakness of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, destruction, and loss of function. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause hoarseness of voice.\n\nSince rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints. Inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjogren's syndrome. Rheumatoid inflammation of the lung lining (pleuritis) causes chest pain with deep breathing or coughing. The lung tissue itself can also become inflamed and sometimes nodules of inflammation (rheumatoid nodules) develop within the lungs. Inflammation of the tissue (pericardium) surrounding the heart, called pericarditis, can cause a chest pain that typically changes in intensity when lying down or leaning forward. The rheumatoid disease can reduce the number of red blood cells (anemia), and white blood cells. Decreased white cells can be associated with an enlarged spleen (referred to as Felty's syndrome) and can increase the risk of infections. Firm lumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure. Even though these nodules usually do not cause symptoms, occasionally they can become infected. A rare, serio5	which will win supercup of Europe?

I'm African and I have been dating an Indian guy who is 34yrs for 2 months now. He treats me so nice on all the dates we've had. Now he has started talking of marraige. I feel that being of a different race will not go down too well with his people so I'm planning to break up with him this weekend. This saddens me so much but what else can I do. What's your opinion? Also he is muslim but insists he isn't a religious person. Sometimes I wish we had never met He always treats you nice?  And now he's talking of marriage?  Just because the family doesn't like you (why should they, in this day and age.  And if they do, that doesn't have anything to do with him) doesn't mean you should break up!  If he asks you to marry him, and then the family expresses a dislike for you, deal with it then.  If he's willing to look past race, so should you be.  Don't worry about the family.  If they're reasonable, they will get past their prejudice, and if they aren't, you have him.  He will want you whether his family does or not. \nIf there is another reason you want to break up with him, think about that.  Why do you really want to break up with him?  And if it is because you're afraid the family won't like you, tell him!  Ask if they won't, and ask how that will affect your and his relationship.  If he feels its a problem, then marriage obviously isn't an option.  But if it isn't, then you can work things out with the family.\nLove will find a way!\nGive him a chance.  \nIf you disagree with his religion, get it out in the open.  If he insists he isnt religious, you need to think about how it will affect your relationship.

Well first of all, that is not a question, it is a statement.  Yet I am going to assume that you are trying to say "How can you save money?" and will answer that question.  I'm sure you have heard of saving 10% of every paycheck and put it into long-term saings.  This is the most important concept in investing and savings.  Yet for most people it is impossible to find space in their budgets.  The only way for many people that this works is to put the money directly into a CD (certificate of deposit - a type of bank account).  This way it is not at all tempting to spend it when you get it.  There is a way to get this done automaticaly, yet I don't really know how (I am 15).  \n\nAll of this is explained in the book "The Wealthy Barber" by David Chilton.  If you were to only read one book in your life, this one is the one you should read.  It goes through basic savings and investment skills while putting it in a way that is entertaining and simple to understand.  Everyone should read this book and everyone can accieve a happy retirement if they follow the advice put forth by Dave.  It is amazing how simple the suggestions that he says are to implement.4	What program is best to learn how to create graphics like the ones used on myspace?

I'm 24 years old, and I really don't want to have to shoot anyone. I don't have a high school diploma, only a GED. That most likely disqualifies me from the Airforce, and the Coast Guard. They accept them but rarely from what I have gathered. I have looked at the Army as a last resort throughout my life. Even though I know that I would do very well within it. I want to be in a intelligence or medical MOS since it would help me when I'm done with my term. I want to know if there is any way to go active, but not be in a combat deployable position? I'm just trying to make sure I make a wise decision and not a foolish one to my own personal morals. I want to join, but love my job... not hate it. I understand about wanting to go into the service. It looks like it might be a way to pay the bills and get some education and a way up. For some of us it was. I was a chemical staff specialist. My job started out being in radiation protection. That was great. It eventually got me where I am today. I teach the stuff in a nuclear power plant.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThe Army decided that they needed me to make and drop napalm, agent orange, white phosphorus, and other stuff like that. I got sent to Vietnam. I was a good soldier. Did what they told me. Even got tortured in training without talking (South Koreans broke my knee in a training exercise). I dropped napalm on people, dude. Burned them to death. Sprayed Agent Orange that we later found out caused all sorts of genetic defects and liver problems in the Vietnamese and in our troops. I watch a helicopter blade take off my pilot's head when we crashed once.\n\nDid not seem much like radiation protection somehow. \n\nAnd then when I got back people spit on me. They called us baby killers. The sentiment about the war had changed. There was no money much to treat vets either (a lot like it is now, btw) and my buddies were very screwed up. I hear that US soldiers coming back now 1 in every three are seeking help about PTSD. Yeah, good idea to seek help. I still have it. Fourth of July is hell for me. Hate unexpected fire crackers.\n\nThe job of the military is to meet with and kill the enemy. The recruiters will try to tell you there are lots of other things to do, but that is the number one job. Right now we are not at war, we are occupying a country that does not want us there. The Iraqi president and VP have both asked for us to leave, have talked about granting amnesty to those who have only killed Americans. The troops on the ground there are tired. They are there to protect the contractors who are raking in the dough on fat no-bid contracts. \n\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\nHow about something like Americorps or Peace Corps? \n\nIf you still are intent on the Army, get everything in writing. When they try to weasel out, show them the paper and leave. Seriously. Recruiters lie and cheat.5	who thinks the pistons are the best?

For the past year or so she's had a kind of rip in the lining of her vagina. We've been trying everything to fix it, doctors, treatments, everything, but it's not going away. We used to enjoy sex very, very much before this happened. Both of us have only been with each other. The big problem is because of things being messed up with her we hardly ever have sex, or even non-intercourse play. I'm an extremely sexual man and I'm starting to get frustrated and feel neglected. I feel horrible because I know it's not her fault at all and she's probably suffering just as much as me. Am I just being selfish? Even with how things are I love her deeply and would never think of leaving her, she's the other half of my soul. By I miss sex with her so bad and it's been so long since we've had a healthy love life my hormones are about to kill me! Anyone have any real, constructive advice? Input from a female perspective would be appreciated. The first thing, as a female...she's probably incredibly insecure about his, even though it's not her fault.  No doubt she misses a healthy sex life, but because you are so important to one another, she's probably feeling a little scared that this is going to ruin one of the greatest things in her life.  So while it's important, you have to make sure she knows that it's not AS important as the relationship the two of you have.  And don't just say it once, remind her.  We girls like to be reassured, because doubt tends to get the better of us.  And don't just say it, make sure your actions support what you say.  Once she's feeling better about herself, explore a temporary non-vaginal-intercourse alternative to abstinence - by talking about it together, being positive and enthusiastic, and by experimenting, which can be loads of fun for a change of pace.  Don't make it about the problem, make it about how fun it can be finding a solution.  You may even find that it makes your sex life better in the long-term by having variety there.5	Can you all BELIEVE the Cavs tied the series? *SIGH* Thats ok though...Detroits goin back home!

You can skip them but If your pills change dose weekly (ex. OTC-lo) you may end up bleeding for a month, or if your lucky just have some spotting. Other pills dont change doses are best for it but still can have spotting. A doctor put my friend who had real bad period problems on the pill 24/7 no more periods ever, but did get unpredictable spotting. The doctor said that it was healthy.  There is going to be a pill on the market soon out that lets you have only once a year.

Global warming is a term used to describe the trend of increases in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans that has been observed in recent decades. The scientific opinion on climate change, as expressed in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report in 2001 and explicitly endorsed by the national science academies of the G8 nations April 2005, is that the average global temperature has risen 0.6 ± 0.2 °C since the late 19th century, and that it is likely that "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities" [1]. The increased volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing and agriculture, and other human activities, are the primary sources of the human-induced component of warming. The natural greenhouse effect keeps the Earth about 33 °C warmer than it otherwise would be; adding carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere, with no other changes, will make that planet's surface warmer.8	We'll how can you tell if he really loves you, but it's over phone?!?  you can't really.8	i'm 28 and my boyfriend is 20 we're celebrating our 1st anniversary this year what should i get him?  a weekend away.. enjoying each others company!2	soory 4 the bad grammar? i get ans answer for the previous q which is,,is mastubation torn or destroy the vergin hymen?and i get an answer mad my friend and she is with me now sooo upset iwanna confirm that info(hymen can b broken easily by orgasm(she get orgasm by tighting her legs soooo tight that is it)becouse muscles cntract and pull the tissue...is that true?is it sooo easy like that to lose? Some hymens are easy to tear, only a thin band of tissue. Some are very hard to get rid of and can even require surgery to cut it. Most hymens are moderate.

My therapist in hometown had advise against me moving closer to this man since he was a Dominant personality.  He also talked me out of moving in with my girlfriend.  Our agreement was I'd do housekeeping for him, we met on persoanls, and have a relationship.  I was to pay off my debt to him by working. He also still has some of my furniture.  Well apparently shortly after I moved up here he decided he didn't like me, and told me so.  After having a intimate relationship I told him it be hard for me to go back to friendship, especially he was only reason I moved up here.

From wikipedia:\n\n"Centrifugal force (from Latin centrum "center" and fugere "to flee") is a term which may refer to two different forces which are related to rotation. Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.\n\nThe reactive centrifugal force is the reaction to the the centripetal force. This is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which exerts the centripetal force. As it is an actual force, it is always present, independent of the choice of reference frame. "\n\nIn terms of the earth's rotation about the sun, the magnitude of earth's centrifugal force is the gravitational attraction between the earth and sun.  Its direction is the vector from the middle of the sun to the middle of the earth (actually, from the center of gravity of each).\n\nIn terms of an object on the earth's surface or in orbit about the earth, the centrifugal force is, again, equal to the force of gravitational attraction between the earth and the object.  The direction of the force is from the earth's center through the object.5	I would like to know the dimensions of a regular foot ball field in feet only.?  300ft long and 150 ft wide\na yars is 3 ft .. 100x50yrds2	Who has had experience with WellBetX for diabetes? and what was your result?  these products don't sound too bad, they are nothing prescribed for diabetes. being non prescription the predictability for these products goes low, but if you have not tried them before they could be worth a try, just let your doctor know that you are going to try 'em out and then watch your sugars closely, good luck5	Hey, if there is a FIFA ranking for players, who will be ur choice for the top 10 players.?

It reduces the demand on our natural resources, saves valuable landfill space, and creates opportunities for new industries. \n\nIf we don’t recycle, we will eventually run out of space for all of our trash.  What will we do with it then? \n\nIt saves money. Almost every trash disposal bill can be reduced by recycling more. For our entire community, this is an important economic consideration. Trash disposal costs are a drain on our local purchasing power, while recycling can generate new revenue from sales of recyclable commodities.\n\nIt saves resources and energy.\nFor every ton of paper we recycle, about 17 trees are saved that would otherwise be cut for paper pulp. Other resources that are saved include 7,000 gallons of water, 380 gallons of oil, and enough electricity to power the average home for six months.\n\nBy recycling a single aluminum can, enough electricity is saved to run a TV for six hours.\n\nBy recycling a single glass bottle, enough electricity is saved to operate a 100 watt light bulb for 4 hours.\n\nIt saves landfill space. A landfill is space which we have destroyed for almost any future use except storing garbage. The less trash we put in landfills, the more land is available for future generations.\n\nHelps to prevent pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes. \n\nIt's the law. To protect our environment, the State of California requires each city and county to recycle 50% of all solid waste by the year 2000. Reaching this goal requires the support of all households and businesses. For more information, call the Mendocino Solid Waste Management Authority at 468-9710.\n\nDid you know?\nThe average U.S. household discards each year 13,000 paper items, 500 aluminum cans, 500 glass bottles, and 1,800 plastic items.\n\nEvery week, more than 500,000 trees are used to produce the two-thirds of newspapers that are never recycled.\n\nAmerican consumers and industry throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial airfleet every 3 months.\n\nTo make a 6-foot long park bench out of recycled plastics ("plastic lumber"), it takes 1,050 recycled milk jugs.\n\nThere's lots of good reasons to recycle!! Do YOU recycle?1	Lefthanded? I am left handed yet I use my right hand to write ,I was forced by my Mother when I was small. I want to write with my lefthand, but it is difficult.

You don't think only with the right side. Although the motor controls for the left side of your body are found in the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa for the right side of your body. There are studies that say that the creative part of your brain and analytical part are in different hemisphers, but that doesn't tie well with me as to how people are. You can be creative and or analytical regardless of which had you write  with.

I kind of like her.

According to this nifty science blog entry, the sneeze impulse affects a variety of body parts, including the abdomen, chest, neck, and face. During a sneeze, the impulses that travel through your face cause your eyelids to blink. This response is entirely automatic. There's nothing you can do about it. Sneezing puts a lot of pressure on your head and respiratory system, so blinking is probably a protective mechanism.\n     The point is that all of these responses (the abdominal contraction, the sharp burst of air out of your lungs, the general lunging movement) are intertwined. When you sneeze, you can't do one without the other.5	How do I remove the cylinder from a Colt single action revolver ?.  It's a 22LR.?

And what speed would the ball have to be travelling to result in death? On February 20, 1998, that Raman Lamba, fielding close to the bat, copped one on the skull off the bat of Mehrab Hossain. Lamba, playing for Abahani Limited after retiring from a long first-class career with Delhi, had just come up to forward short leg, and did not wear a helmet, contending that he only had three balls to field in that position. \n\nMehrab, who would later go on to play for Bangladesh, was batting for Mohammedan and struck a short ball fiercely. The ball was hit with such power that it ricocheted off Lamba's head, and ballooned to Khaled Mashud, the wicketkeeper, who had to backpedal to take the catch. \n\nLamba, shaken and with an understandably nasty headache, dusted himself off, picked himself up and walked off the ground unassisted. When he reached the changerooms, the team doctor laid Lamba down, and gave him a glass of water to drink. By this time the hemorrhaging had begun. Finally, when the gravity of the situation became obvious, Lamba was taken to the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research, then considered the best centre for neurology in Bangladesh. But by then, it was too late.2	is there any food or tablet that contains ALL the essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids? ...for example is it possible to live on just spirallina and chlorella? Nope. The reason is - we haven't yet discovered ALL the essential nutrients yet. Let's take carotenoids, for example. Science has found hundreds of new ones in just the last couple years and continues to find new ones regularly. Our bodies are extremely complex systems which have evolved to eat a variety of foods from nature.\n\nThe best thing you can do to ensure you get what your body needs to be healthy is to eat a wide range of real foods. Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are always good choices - color generally equals nutrients (with a few exceptions like cauliflower - no color but lots of vitamins and minerals).\n\nAlso, you missed on thing - essential fatty acids. Your body can't live or produce new cells without Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats.3	Can you please give me information on Little Richie?  http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/michie/richie.html2	If It Hurts When You Pee What Could Be Wrong.?

It's more feminine and professional.  But my parents think if I change my name it will affect my credit, college transcripts, etc.  They said it would be hard in the future to get a job or a loan because changing your first name makes you look suspicious.  Is this true?  I really want to go through with it but not if it's going to be a huge hassle. LOL I changed my whole name once, completely different. I even eliminated my middle name entirely. All it takes (here in my county) is $75.00 and an appearance in a small claims court. You answer a few questions, such as why you are changing your name, if you are doing so to evade creditors (which the answer has to be 'no'), etc. After the judge grants you the change, you have to send in for a change on your birth certificate, social security card, and whatever else. It is really easy, and for such a small change as your's, it will be even easier. Very few applications ask whether you have ever gone by another name. I work in healthcare so I had to disclose my other name once, but that was it. You know what? I changed my name back, a year later. I just decided to go back to my original name, and it was even easier than the first change. Hopefully, it is the same in your area, but laws do sometimes differ.2	smell make me sick. what is wrong with me. the smell of seafood and red meat make me very ill.? the smell of seafood and red meat make me very ill. it wasn't like that all the time. and no i am not pregnant. it has gotten progressevly worse.

I know about how individual clubs do fundraisers and handle the money, so that's what I'll tell you about.\n\nIn the high school where I teach, each club/organization has its own account.  The teacher takes all money and writes receipts, then turns the money and copies of the receipts in to the Bookkeeper right away.  The Bookkeeper makes the deposit into the bank account, keeping the receipt books and all the documentation in her files.  Occasionally the district audits the records to make sure all the forms are there and all the money adds up correctly.  The club submits a check request whenever it needs to pay for something, and the Bookkeeper processes the request and sends the check to the appropriate place.  If the club is purchasing something, the teacher first gets a purchase order and provides the supplier with the purchase order number as proof that the purchase order will be paid.  When the product is delivered, the teacher receives the shipment and informs the Bookkeeper that it's OK to pay the purchase order.  Then the Bookkeeper pays the supplier with funds from the club's account.2	How can you reduce wrinkles without spending a Lot of money?

Since the sun is a variable star, its solar output varies slightly over short time periods. Solar disturbances such as flares, prominences, and sunspots increase the amount of radiation from the sun. However, no long-term variations in the intensity of solar radiation have been measured at altitudes above Earth’s atmosphere. Solar radiation, at about 1,400 W/m2, varies by no more than 2%. In contrast, the geothermal heat flow from Earth averages only about 0.061 W/m2. Some theories have related climatic changes to sunspot cycles (11 years) and magnetic cycles (22 years), but no clear connection has yet been established between climate and sunspots or magnetic cycles. \n\nThe sun emits energy as electromagnetic radiation. Unlike sound, such radiation requires no medium, therefore this energy is able to travel through the near vacuum of space from the sun to the earth. \n\nMost radiant energy from the sun is concentrated in the visible and near-visible parts of the EM spectrum, and it peaks at about 500 nm, very near the 555 nm visibility peak for Homo sapiens, a result which surely is not a coincidence (and is connected to evolution). Less than 1% of solar radiation is emitted as X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves. \n\nOnly about 25%, or about 350 W/m2, of incoming solar radiation penetrates the transparent atmosphere of the earth. The remainder is either absorbed by the atmosphere or scattered back into space. There are some latitudinal differences found on Earth. These variations are determined by time of year, by the wavelength of the energy being transmitted, and by the depth and nature of the intervening material. \n\nTerrestrial radiation is produced mainly as a result of reradiation of solar radiation. The energy is absorbed from the sun as the sun’s spectrum but reradiated from Earth at the much longer wavelengths associated with the temperature of Earth. The Wien displacement law, in which the wavelength is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, provides a comparison of those peak wavelengths. \n\nSince the sun has a surface temperature 20 times greater than that of Earth, the reradiated energy has a spectrum that peaks at a wavelength 20 times longer than the 500 nm for the sun, or at about 10,000 nm, well into the infrared. Since the atmosphere is more absorptive to such long-wavelength terrestrial radiation, the atmosphere is heated from the ground up instead of vice versa. \n\nIn addition, water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb the long wavelengths of radiation from the earth especially well, leading to the so-called "greenhouse" effect. (The temperature in real greenhouses rises mainly because the glass prevents the heated air from rising, thereby increasing the temperature inside.) Ozone, on the other hand, absorbs only very short wavelengths, mainly in the ultraviolet range, and therefore forms a shield of sorts, absorbing much of the ultraviolet radiation before it can reach the earth. \n\nRadiation from the sun follows an inverse square law, so that comparisons of the solar constant can be made for other planets if we know their mean distances from the sun in AU. For example, Mars is 1.93 times further from the sun than is Earth. Its solar constant should therefore be about 27% that of Earth, about 374 W/m2. Because there is little atmosphere to absorb the energy, this is about the same as what we receive at the surface of Earth. \n\nSpacecraft have provided us with temperature measurements for both Mars and Venus. Mars has an average temperature of about 5 oC, whereas Venus has a temperature of about 500 oC. Earth is about 1.4 times further away from the sun than is Venus, and we would expect from the inverse square law that it would receive about twice as much radiation. The fact that its temperature is so much greater can be attributed only to greenhouse warming. \n\nWinter and summer seasons on Earth are a consequence not just of the obliquity factor associated with the sun’s r7	Did you know that Mercury will cross the sun Wednesday...? WASHINGTON - An infrequent astronomical sight — tiny Mercury inching across the surface of the sun — takes place Wednesday afternoon in North America. But you'll need the right kind of telescope to see it. \n\nMercury is so tiny — 1/194th the size of the sun — and looking at the sun is so dangerous to the eyes that viewing must be done with a properly outfitted telescope or online telescope cameras, experts say.\n\nStill, for many people, it may be the only chance to see the closest planet to the sun, said Michelle Nichols, a master educator at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, one of many places that will hold special viewings of Mercury's trek. Mercury is usually seen in the early evening, but it's often obscured by buildings, city lights and trees, she said.\n\n"You definitely need a telescope to spot this one, a properly filtered telescope," Nichols said. "You will see a small black dot against the face of a bright sun."\n\nSeveral Web sites, including those from mountain peaks Wow girl you wrote a lot sorry I couldn't read the whole thing I've got A.D.D., I'm going on 2 hours of sleep over 3 days and I'm coked out by this energy syrup called Red Line I'm using to work out, but I did not know that, I'm just an ignorant man so please forgive me.

Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\n\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of "pork barrel " spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim "We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals".\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals.

Both African and European, if possible... Laden or unladen?\n\nIs it gripping it by the husk?\n\nI know! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut. So, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right? Yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow, that's my point. But then of course African swallows are not migratory.\nWait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together? they'd have to have it on a line... Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of creeper! Held under the dorsal guiding feathers... Well, why not?\n\nHmmm... weight = X trial 1 X trial 2 X trial 3 = #VALUE\n+\ndistance = a?\n\nNow all we need are a couple of swallows and a coconut (and the strand of creeper)!!!9	how can we erase criminal conviction? how can criminal conviction NOT ruin one's life?

Like many other insects, the body of an army ant has a head, thorax and abdomen. The head has a mouth, eyes and antennae. The mouth has two jaws called mandibles that are like scissors. Still, army ants can only swallow liquids because the solids form a ball that the ant spits out. Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes (but they are still blind). Army ants use their antennae to sense smell and touch. This is how they know which colony and nest they belong to. They use their antennae to communicate as well. The thorax is connected to the head by joints called nodes. The thorax is between the head and abdomen. It is connected to the abdomen by a narrow waist called the petiole. The abdomen is in the shape of an oval. That is where the stomach, large intestine, sting, etc. are located.6	Is it hard for an American to find work in the UK?  yes7	in which movie have you heard ben by michael jackson?  ummm...

I have aways had bad printing skills. I think I print at probably a grade 2-5 level. I have had major problems just writing my name. For example I was about 16 years old before I could write my name. I still cannot write I only know a select few letters and have the skill to remember then and write them neatly enough.\n\nI can print anything though I am not a retard. but my printing even if I take my time is still worse then probably 90-95% of the people I know. If I do not take my time sometimes it is hard for me to understand my own printing.  I had an IEP and was in special ed classes my whole life until the end of high school well not so much in high school your only allowed to take like 3 I think and still get a diploma. My best guesses would be dysgraphia or dyspraxia.  There are links to the Wikipedia pages below.  Not the most reliable resource in the world, but I think it will give you a general idea of what each of those is about.

I had it working before, but i got a apple airport extreme. Whenever i try to do it it times out, but it has something to do with configuring the ports, what do i need to do? (i know the ip addresses), Also what vnc program for mac do you suggest?Because i have 2 macs +3 windows.\n\nThank you all. Not too sure about Airport time out issues either.  For VNC, I use that a lot between my Macs and PCs.   On the Mac (10.4 preferred), you can either turn on Apple's own Apple Remote Desktop (System Pref -> Sharing, choose Apple Remote Desktop.  Click on Access privileges, grant yourself full access + check on the VNC viewers ... and set a password)  OR OSXVNC (free ... the new version is called Vine Server)  To install this guy, download it from their site (you can do a Yahoo search on osxvnc).  Double click the DMG file, drag and drop the content (Vine Server) onto your Application folder.  To configure it, launch the app, set a password and you're set to go!  Client for VNC, I would go with "Chick of the VNC".  Do the same get process as osxvnc, search for it on Yahoo, get the DMG, drag to Application folder and launch!  It can memorize your controlled machines, which is cool.  It doesn't care if the destination is Mac or Win as long as you have the right IP address and password.  Right clicking on a VNC Win machine can be a pain if you don't have dual button mouse.  You have to hold down control + shift + click to do right click on the PC you're controlling.\n\nOn Windows, I use UltraVNC (also free).  It comes with both server and clients.  The server is as easy to setup as OSXVNC (when you launch it, it stays on your tray, double click it to give it a password)  Then, with the client, supply the IP address of the Mac or Win you want to control + password.  There's also WinVNC -- the downside is that WinVNC will auto start itself, you have to manually shut it down if you don't want it running all the time.  There are 64 bit versions of the VNC for UltraVNC -- do a quick yahoo search of "ultravnc 64"2	What's the best medicine or treatment for someone who has gall bladder stone?

How much gas can a car pump in 30 minutes?  These are just similar ratios:\n\n500 gallons / 20 minutes = x gallons / 30 minutes\n\n500 / 20 = x / 30\n\nNow solve for x (you can cross multiply if you like):\n20x = 15000\nx = 750 gallons.\n\nIt's also rather intuitive to see that you got 500 gallons in 20 minutes.  So in 10 minutes more, you will pump half again as much.  500 + 250 = 750 gallons.8	Any1 here whos as bored as me?? temme what 2 do naa plzz!!!!!

Answer 3.\n\nThe number of x-ray events is directly dependent on the mA setting - each electron will cause an x-ray quant as it is decelerated.\n\nHigher kVp will make the x-rays more energetic, i.e. less likely to interact with light elements on their way to the film.\n\nLow atomic number means that only softer radiation can be absorbed by the atom, creating less of a white shadow on the film.4	what is ERP beans?

Painkillers can become severely habit forming, especially if you have been taking them for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.)

You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try.

Go to any store and buy something. Then read what the label says. Usually it says "made in China". If you stop trading with them, you won't get the microwave or toaster or the laptop or the memory chip inside the laptop or the iPod or the shirt or the sneakers.. and you will become like the people in Africa. Because when you send manufacturing jobs abroad, you stop and tear down the factories and stop training the labor force, and stop producing the capital goods needed to make the factory again and stop training the labor force to build those capital goods.. and so on. It's a long chain backwards: the supply chain. You don't have a supply chain anymore. Just like Africa. What you do have is money to buy the products from that supply chain. In order to keep your civilization alive, you need China. Or you could rebuild the industries in the USA from scratch.

Go to the Federal Bankruptcy Court you will be filing with, pick-up the packet they provide with all the paperwork. The clerks cannot give legal advice (should you include this or that), but they can answer questions about the process itself (the steps you take, where it will go, time periods between filing, meeting the trustee, period creditors can oppose, when it finally it is discharged). This all is if it's cut and dry Chapter 7 and once you read through the packet you should be able to figure if it's too complicated and should get a lawyer.\nYou do the majority of the work whether it's Chapter 7 or 11, by yourself or a lawyer, so don't pay 3 months salary for something that could be as easy as filing a 1040EZ tax form.\nEducate yourself before your make someone else responsible for your future.\nI know people will yell at me, so what.\nBTW: the vast majority of bankruptcies are businesses and not individuals, so don't let someone guilt you out.5	Qui va gagner demain en ouverture du match de foot France Grèce:France 98 ou France 2000???

Is there a certain brand or type that's good for mountain bikes? I know NOTHING about the trainers. Cycle-Ops is a good trainer. They run anywhere from about $150 or so for a wind trainer up to about $250-300 for a fluid trainer. The wind trainer is the closest to a real ride feel (but noisy) with the fluid running it a close second in terms of feel but much quieter. You will need to get rid of the knobby tire for a smooth tread one like the others have said. Another trainer to consider is the Minoura rim drive. It runs the resistance on the side walls of the rim instead of the tire. The max speed recommended is about 25mph from what I remember but the bright side is that it won't wear down your tires so the knobbies can stay.9	Why are some prisoners given sentences that are longer than they are likely to be alive to finish?  because due to some appeals the years are reduced and this way it cant be reduced and the person automatically released- alot of times the reduced amount may be half the original time and turn out to let the con out in his golden years1	There were 18 of these in 2005.

However, there was a report released in Science Magazine in September of 2005 that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has nearly doubled (I believe the rise was actually 80%) over the past three decades, to an average of 18 per year. That doesn't exactly answer your question because the year wasn't over when that number came out, and it is an average, but that number made a lot of headlines. I think that annual average number of hurricanes may be your answer. \n\nThis is important because this is being tied to effects of global warming, and the threat of things getting even worse.0	Do you believe in luck?

I'm 21 yrs. old and all I've ever really wanted to do was sing and dance for a living.  I don't want to be a starving artist and I realize that this won't pay the bills if I don't get lucky.  I want to go back to school, but I don't know of anything else that would make me happy.  Does anybody have any suggestions for me?  Or can you at least tell me if you love your job what it is that you do? Absolutely!!!! I am an emt and ems dispatcher for a large hospital based ems service. I can't think of anything more exciting or rewarding. I didn't always feel that way. I went from one dead end job to another until I finally stumbled into this one. I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Just keep your eyes open and nose to the grind stone. Best of luck and work hard toward your goals and passions, and don't ever let anybody put you down for your dreams, but don't be too quick to pass on opportunities as they come your way. You're still young and you don't know what life may have in store for you. Break a leg.0	what do you think of thirteen yr olds? Im a thirteen yr old named Brad...what do you think of thirteen yr olds?i think thirteen yr olds deserve more credit and responsibilitys,we cant drive,vote or drink....why?some of us are responsible...some "adults" are not...what do you think of thirteen yr olds? You're right that being mature and responsible doesn't come automatically at age 18.\n\nThirteen is a good age - you're old enough to start enjoying yourself, but young enough not to have any real worries or responsibilities.\n\nDon't try to grow up too fast - you've got years and years of that ahead of you. Have fun being a teenager.3	what is the cost to keep smeone in jail for the rest of their life and what is the cost of the death penalty?  The average cost per day to house an inmate varies.  The death penalty on the other hand costs approximately two million. Check this link out for additional facts.1	Is polypropolene eco-friendly?  Most people who know anything about science think so.  When you say "eco-friendly" I assume that you mean "non-poisonous".  The chief complaint would be that the stuff just does not break down.  It takes aeons to break down.  However, it is inert to your body and anything else alive.  It is a super-long hydrocarbon which has no reactive functional groups whatsoever and hence can't really do anything other than burn.  By the way - it's spelled polypropylene.1	a program to calculate this:Pn(x)=Y0L0(x)+Y1L1(x)+...+YnLn(x)which:Li(x)= n∏(x-xj)/(xi-xj)J=0&j≠i in C?

Do online degrees, particularly those from schools that are primarily or exclusively online, carry the same weight as a traditional degree? Honestly, it depends on the employer, the position, and what you hope to do with the degree. \n\nIf you want to move up within your own company, in all likelihood an online degree will help you. It won't hurt you. \n\nHowever, if you plan to change employers, some employers do not consider certain online degrees on par with degrees from brick-and-mortar universities. \n\nTo be completely blunt, if I were looking at your resume, and you had an online degree from some online school, there is no way I'd hire you. However, if you had an online degree from a reputable university, like RPI - they have a great rep as a brick-and-mortar university, and so that carries over to their online degrees - I'd hire you. Likewise, an online degree from UMass, I'd hire you. But from U Phoenix? To be quite honest, I'd pass.9	what is the legality of town tax assessor entering premises? I don't think it is necessary for an assessor to gain entry to my home. It seems to me that our forefathers died to defend our right to privacy. I think the town can assess me from outside of my house just as well as inside. Our county assessor has never been in our home.  But he's more interested in the outbuildings.  Contact their office, and ask to see the ruling, or law.6	Do I own half of my house? My husband bought our house before we married.  We have re-financed since then and the bank required my signature on the loan papers.  I believe the deed and the tax records only have his name on them.  Is this legally half my house?  If my husband died - would the house be mine and/or am I responsible for the loan? It does depend on the state you live in.  Best bet is to file wills and have your name put on the deed w/rights of survivorship.  You can actually file these yourself in the county courthouse.  Don't let a lawyer charge you too much for this.  It's a very simple process.\n\nAnd it's called "dower".  Not all states have it.  You co-signed on the second loan, and therefore are responsible for the loan, though not the home itself (you couldn't file your own mortgage - this also varies by state).1	what is the answer if i differentiate 3x^4 + 5/x^3? is it 12x^3 - 15/x^4 let z=3x^4+5/x^3\n=>dz=3.4x^3+5x^-3\n=>dz=12x^3+(-3).5x^-4\n=>dz=12x^3 - 15/x^4\nur right!!!4	How to download the simpsons for free in MPEG-4 ?

Every guys will want different things.  I like long hair, preferably red.  An attractive figure is also great.  Superficial acrostics aside, she needs to be able to carry a conversation.  I would rather have an average looking girl that is equally smart and can hold an intelligent conversation, rather than a perfect 10 that all guys drool over.  With a girl that is EXTREMELY beautiful you sometimes wonder if she is being faithful.  That takes allot of faith on the guys part to trust her  just as it takes trust for the girl to think the guys is not cheating.  If the girl can't say anything smart allot of people will look at her and think/know she is a ditz.  I know I am rambling on so, in my opinion intelligence, good looks, loyalty, willingness to compromise, horneyness.6	Why do you wanna work in a call center?

Stratigraphy is the analysis of sediment layers and their correlation to time. Events in a stratigraphy are exceptional layers which were deposited due to a special occurrance - most commonly fire, but also think of the huge ash and lava deposits over Pompeii and Herculaneum, or the Iridium-rich layer on the end of the Jurassic Age commonly connected to the Yucatan meteorite impact.\n\nIn Archaeology or Palaeontology event layers are extremely valuable. Quite often they contain collateral damage of the event which can be dated to the event, and objects which normally wouldn't have been included in the sediment. Schliemann used the ash layers to distinguish several different stages of Troy.

The orbital period is about 27 years, with an eclipse duration of about 18 months. The visible companion is a yellowish (F-class) supergiant. The type of the other star is not known. ζ Aurigae has a period of 970 days, the primary is a (K-class) supergiant and the secondary is a (B-class) main sequence star. Both these systems present a rare stage of binary evolution, as the components are in a short and active evolutionary stage.5	Who is responsible for Hotel bills (Accommodation) during the World Cup Final?

While there is no real definition for what a actual hippie was, at least there wasn't in the day.  People would get together I can remember and discuss who was an actual hippie and who wasn't.  Now the older generation knew for sure that everone who wore their hair long was a for sure hippie, however that was not always the case.  Where did they go, well they went from not trusting anybody over thirty to not trusting anybody below thirty,(seems to be a common age there),some became yuppies and all remain free spirts at heart.  The hippies did not go anywhere they just became the establishment that they used to fight.  It all comes full circle.

How do I lose weight quickly? How do I lose weight quickly? Ive slowly put on 120 pounds after last nine years and I need to look my best in two weeks, how can I lose these 120 pounds? Maybe if I cut my calorie intake by 1/2? Do I exercise any? Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two "healthy meals" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to.3	If  y = f(x^2) and f '(x) = sin2x,  find dy/dx?  go ask your maths tutors. . .thanks for 2 points8	Would you do me? Answer ONLY if you are a straight, unattached female! I'm not answering the question since I don't meet the aforementioned criteria, I'm just posting.  Don't ya just love how all of the answerers ASSUMED you were referring to "sex"?  I know what you meant.  You meant "do" as in what the Mafia does to someone they don't like.  But if you were going to be "offed" would it matter so much that they be a straight female?  I would prefer it myself, I suppose.  Maybe she would be a necrophiliac, and I'd be able to get me some even when I was dead.  Now THAT would be something to brag about to my buddies!  Well, assuming they were all dead as well.

Big business wants to flood legal immigration going forward and get cheap labor to depress wages. But they insist the jobs are those 'Americans won't do'. Idea is they have to show Americans won't do them before they can get fresh guest workers. At the last minute the Senate added a rule that that has to be at 'the prevailing wage' a law used to govern fair wages at Federal sites. Poor big business knows they won't be able to exploit cheap labor as much that way and is trying to say (behind the scenes) that the fair wage law is unfair because American workers often make less than that, since the standard applies only to government jobs. So, construction workers etc. out there, is it unfair to you to say new guest workers can't be brought in unless paid the prevailing wage?  I'm not in construction, so I'm curious as to how you feel. i feel like were getting bent over by the politicians...\n\nthe lower the politicians and big companies can make wages, the less citizens will want those jobs and thats when they can say we wont take them...\n\nif illegal aliens were deported those jobs would have to pay higher or go away to mechanization...\n\nthe way it is now, illegals are stopping our kids and low income people from taking those entry level jobs...\n\nin construction, illegals working under the table make it cheaper for a company to build something and therefore more competitive and profitable than a company that plays by the rules...1	how much does a baby elephant weighs?  between 250 and 350 pounds7	NY1 know any good anime movies in the akira mould?

I can't see how a female is capable of such actions, is it really true that females are just as capable of sexual abuse as guys? It just really weirds me out... I hope that so-called 'female' is locked up for life. Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex...  sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching..  making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more...  so, if this woman made your friend touch her..  or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging...  could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.0	How did a "myth" change the world as we know it? Several writers have suggested that "Jesus did not exist"...that the Christian faith is mere invention. This silly notion has absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever. Even secular sources (such as the Roman historian Tacitus) acknowledge the early Christian faith. Nero persecuted/killed hundreds of CHRISTIANS around 64 AD. Domitian did the same at the close of the 1st century. Did these people die for a "myth".  If the historical account of Christ could be so easily disproved...why wasn't that done?  The fact is, NO ONE challenged the historical record of Christ...they only disagreed with who He said He was. 1FoolN6Billion:What proof do you have that there was a Jesus who was called king of the Jews?\n\nKepha: It’s been recorded by several eyewitnesses that Pontius Pilate ordered a sign be put on the cross, “King of the Jews”, and I mean by more than just what’s in the bible. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: What writings have been found before 150 years after the supposed fact?\n\nKepha: The Gospels were generally accepted as scripture by 130 AD.  People don’t die over a myth or story, they die because they were transformed and refused to break their fidelity with God by giving homage to Roman gods. An atheist is blind to such things. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: And to answer your initial question, the myth caused the dark ages, where people were kept, by their religious authorities, from being literate, \n\nKepha: This is a flat out falsehood. Universities were built all over Europe in the middle ages, and before the Protestant revolt, even the poor could attend without charge. And just where do you think the “religious authorities” got their education? Or were they illiterate too? DUH,  HELLO???\n \n1FoolN6Billion: ESPECIALLY from reading the bible, \n Kepha: This is another big fat lie. \nDid the Catholic Church Try to Keep the Bible From the Laity?\nhttp://www.cathinsight.com/apologetics/adventism/bible.htm\n\nIt’s a lot of reading, so scroll to the last 1/3 of the page to get what you want.\n\nBIBLE  READING  PROHIBITED  ?\nhttp://members.aol.com/johnprh/latinbible.html\nThis one is not too long.

Lots of it. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: which they were constantly editing for their own goals.\n\nWho, exactly? Name the goals. Painstaking efforts were made to preserve the bible translated from the original Greek and Hebrew. St. Jerome was fluent in both. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: The dark ages started with emperor Constantine,\n \nKepha: According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages, the “Dark Ages” didn’t start until Constantine was rotting in the ground for 100 years.   \n\n1FoolN6Billion: who liked the idea of being able to absolve all of his sins, and especially liked the idea of claiming that he was ordained under the one and only all-powerful god, making everything that he did anyway "God's will."\n\nKepha: Constantine did no such thing, and you have not a shred of proof. Constantine was never a priest or bishop, and did not have any church authority at the Council of Nicae, (or anywhere else) which took place 12 years after his famous “Edict of Milan”, which was nothing more than a removal of persecuting laws still on the books. You are in serious revision mode. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: Then it caused the inquisitions, killing more people in a short period than just about anything else thus far, where Jews were required to at least say that Jesus was an historical person if not the messiah.\n\nKepha: I dare you to document this hogwash. Reliable non-Catholic historians don’t buy into that post-reformist rhetoric. Here is my proof, but I know you will never read it: \nThe modern historiography of the Inquisition, MOST OF IT BY NON-CATHOLIC HISTORIANS, has resulted in a careful, relatively precise, and on the whole rather moderate image of the institution, some of the most important works being: Edward Peters, Inquisition; Paul F. Grendler, The Roman Inquisition and the Venetian Press; John Tedeschi, The Prosecution of Heresy; and Henry Kamen, The Spanish Inquisition. \nSome of their conclusions are: http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/1112-96/column1.html  I dare ya.1	Solve the given differential equation by annihilator method:-y'' + 4y' + 4y = 2x + 6?

Ok, at the risk of sounded conceited, I think I'm a pretty good catch.  I'm 22, a law student, a member of Phi Beta Kappa...I ride horses, play the cello, sing, and ski.  I love to travel, and most guys tell me I'm really attractive.  Yet, I'm always told, "If I had known you liked me, I would have asked you out."  Why do guys find me so intimidating? Today in this world, women in general have proven that they are able to anything when they put their mind to it. That can match the work force of a man. But what aslo now comes with this is now a telling to guys you are no longer dependent... a guys mind works to help those who need help. If you can do everthing yourself we have nothing to feel good about ourselves. We like being able to fix the car, mow the lawn, sharpen the blades for the mower, fix plumming, and etc. If you have no need for that then it makes it hard to break the ice. So do to culture shock of women takeing a little more control in this world the roles have now become even. There for It would be safe to say as well you might want to think about why is it that you aren't approaching them, and asking them. Most girls say well a girl wants to be picked up by a knight. wisked off her feet. Well If you your self make your self in to a "independent" woman you now need to except you may need to be the knight.

I was thinking maybe the 535 ATS Slugster. Has anyone ever owned one? are there any problems with it? Bound's hubby here:\n\nI would recommend a Remington Model 870 pump shotgun. Remington offers two different type of Model 870, the Express and teh WingMaster. \n\nThe 870 Express is an affordable entry level five shot, pump action shotgun. It has an alloy receiver, hardwood stock, and a phosphate/parkerized finish. You can generall find this model on sale at Dick's Sporting Goods for about $260 or with a bird barrel and a deer barrel for about $340.\n\nThe Model 870 WingMaster is a more traditional five shot, pump action shotgun. It comes with a steel receiver, blued finish and walnut stocks (it's prettier). The Model 870 WingMaster has been around since the early 1950's. It is durable, it is long lasting, it is reliable and it is fool proof. You can buy one (depending u[on grade) starting at about $600. \n\nI have had bad experiences in the past with the Mossberg line. I would not recommend one. The Winchester line that is currently being produced is very limited. \n\nI would recommend a pump shotgun (Remington 870, Browning BPS) over a semi-automatic because of safety versus experience level. Double barrel shotguns are good but limiting. A pump, using the plug, gives you a third shot as back-up that a double barrel just doesn't offer. I think single shot shotguns (unless it's the only thing you can afford) are severly limiting and shouldn't be counted on for hunting. \n\nGood luck.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: \nFor Randkl: I had a Mossberg Model 144 bolt blow apart on me while shooting standard velocity .22 long rifle ammunition in a match. The bolt handle separated, and the bolt backed half-way out of the receiver. Yes, it may have been a fluke, but it happened ... fortunately there was no physical injury ... but it DID happen! My gunsmith determined that it was a product flaw/quality control issue ... Perhaps this incident was isolated and not indicative of the Mossberg line ... but I consider myself fortunate ... and I do not wish to take another chance on Mossberg's products ... my choice ... I am not imposing it on anyone!\n\nAgain, Good luck!2	I wanna be more outgoing and like not scared anymore! How can I feel myself without being scared at all? Im not all that scared but i wanna be stronger The most important thing to remember is: No matter how beautiful or talented somebody is, we all have insecurities and all want to be liked by others (maybe not ALL but 99% of us).  So don't go thinking that you're the only scared person in the room.\n\nYou'd be surprised at what feedback you receive by simply smiling at somebody, or if you go out somewhere, make an effort to make somebody else feel more comfortable or better about themselves.  \n\nSlowly you will start to feel a lot more positive about yourself, hold your head a little higher and know that you're a worthwhile person.  \n\nMake sure you are true to yourself as well, if you're trying to be somebody you're not, you'll just frustrate yourself.  Don't get yourself down if somebody says or does anything that makes you feel bad - did they really intend to hurt you?  \n\nYou're the person you'll be stuck with through all the good times and bad times in your life so you'll need to be your own coach and support, you can't expect anybody else to.  \n\nThink of yourself as a product on a shelf - you're unique, somebody out there will need it, not everybody wants it, some will use it and throw it away - but nobody's going to try it if it sits up the back where nobody can reach it.\n\nHold your chin up, act confident (even if you're really scared) and people will respond well to that, and eventually you'll believe your own act.  Good luck!0	who here HATES preps?

In a few minutes the walls begin to shake as Matt lets out a high pitched, "Yippee Ky AAAAAAAAAA."9	Why all this bickering between Democrats and Republicans over immigration ? Is all this bickering a smoke screen?  It seems that as long as one party can blame the other, nothing gets done, and maybe that's what the government wants.   They don't want to solve the problem.  They want this illegal labor force to remain here.  There would be a lot of unhappy employers, who would lose a lot of money if these illegals were deported.  Both Democrats and Republicans have ties to the wealthy, who are profiting most from illegal labor.  It looks like all both parties are doing is just playing word games with each other and trying to fool the American people in the process. Excellent question.  From what I have seen, it's almost like Democrats are becoming Repulican and vice versa.\nI don't know why they just don't enforce the law as it stands.  I agree with what you say on the cheap labor issue also, which benefits the employers most.  It certainly is not cheap labor for the rest of us. I think what we need is a third party.  And I will vote for anyone who believes that illegal immigration is ruining this country.3	O2 exchange?  2	My husbands left eye always looks red but not the right eye. What causes this?  Does your husband suffer with allergies?  It could be a reaction to something he came in contact with.  Does he rub the eye a good bit?

If his eye problem does not go away in the next day, tell him he should see a eye doctor.  It could be more serious than allergies.  Eye sight is a precious gift we all have.  If the problem persists, he should get it looked at and taken care of ASAP.  Good luck!7	why cant i  see the videos orhear the radio on my computer?  I agree with the first answer.

I am going to school to be in Healthcare management I have done my reshearch and saw they make 65k or more is it worth it or should we wait. That all depends on what part of Healthcare management you'll be going for.  Alot of websites say what the average that someone makes in a certain field, but do more research and compare how long it will take you to pay back your loans.\n\nTry looking on http://www.craigslist.com  under the jobs section, and type in the specific job you'll be applying for after college, make sure to check out what type of schooling they desire to be an applicant.  In the healthcare field, stay away from the "assistant" jobs, if you look around, they go through the same time amount of school as more specific programs, and get paid less than half. \n\nExample, look up "Medical Assistant" vs. "RN" and also "Dental Assistant" vs. "Dental Hygienist"\n\nIf you're already married, i'd definatly recommend going for a specific program like DHY, or RN.  You'll make more money, in the same amount of time.4	how do you make your own web site?(free)?  ◙  Free Geocities Homepage ◙ \n\n◙ Signup for the free Geocities homepage here http://geocities.yahoo.com/ps/learn2/HowItWorks4_Free.html Be careful Yahoo likes to fool you so you will accidentally signup for one of their premium (paid) accounts.

I need the answer like...NOW my project is do tomorrow on 5-26 The Second Punic War broke out in 218 when Hannibal took control of the Greek city and Roman ally, Saguntum (in Spain). Rome thought it would be easy to defeat Hannibal, but Hannibal, leaving 20,000 troops with his brother Hasdrubal, went further north on the Rhone River than the Romans expected and crossed the river with his elephants on flotation devices. \n\nHannibal reached the Po Valley with less than half his men. He had also encountered unexpected resistance from local tribes, although he did manage to recruit Gauls. This meant he had 30,000 troops by the time he met the Romans in battle. \n\nHannibal won battles in Trebia and at Lake Trasimene, and then continued through the Apennine Mountains. With troops from Gaul and Spain on his side, Hannibal won another battle, against Lucius Aemilius, in which the Romans lost thousands of troops, including their leader. The historian Polybius describes the both sides of this, the Battle of Cannae, as gallant, and says of the losses:\n--\nHannibal's army in Iberia reportedly totaled 90,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, although those figures probably include Hasdrubal's forces as well as Hannibal's. The expeditionary force would still number as many as 75,000 foot soldiers and 9,000 horsemen. His army also had an unknown number of war elephants. \n\nAfter completing his overland journey, Hannibal descended from the foothills into northern Italy. He had arrived, however, accompanied by only half the forces he had started with, and only a few elephants. In total, Hannibal had lost as many as 20,000 men and all but three of his war elephants9	Who was the Iraqi press guy in the first gulf war?

A company employs 110 people in total (headcount). The company has  2.5% of staff  in HR, a sales and marketing staff which is 15% of the headcount and the remainder in Administration. The Administration consists of VPs and Admin Assistants. The number of Admin Asst are 10.5 more than the number of VPs.\n\nWhat is the number of Admin Assistants in the company?\n\nDue to a new round of venture capital funding, the company increases the total head count by 50%. The Administration now represents 80% of the headcount and there was no change in the HR staff. What percentage of the company is the sales and Marketing?\n\nOne year later, the company decides to have a head count reduction (layoff) of 30%. Administration and Sales and Marketing Departments were affected by the reduction. Administration lost 61 people more than Sales and Marketing. After the reduction what percentage of employees are in the Administration? HR=110*.025=2.75 (I hope 0.75 means part-time employee)\nSales = 110*0.15 = 16.5 \n100-2.75-16.5=80.75 ppl in Admin\nx=# Assistants\nx + x/10.5 = 80.75\nx=80.75/(1+1/10.5)=73.7283\n\nAfter venture capital:\ntotal headcount =110*1.5=165\nAdmin = 0.8*165=132\nSales=165-132-2.75=30.25\n\nAfter Layoff:\ntotal: 165*(1-0.3)=115.5\nAdmin+Sales = 115.5-2.75=112.75\nAdmin lost x ppl\n132-x +30.25-(x-61) = 112.75\n 2x=132+30.25+61-112.75\n x=55.25\nadmin share = (132-55.25)/115.5=66.45%\n\nNote: company laid off 165*0.3=49.50 people, so "Administration lost 61 people more than Sales" means Sales got more people9	Why does the law( at least in the Philippines) prohibits the killing of dogs as food consumption?

Why does the law allows Chinese to kill and eat cats?\n\nIt is because most lawmakers are Christians? Even the Bible did not prohibit it.\n\nWhat about in your country? well, maybe you're kind of true!\nmaybe it is because the majority of the law makers are christians, that's why they only prohibits whatever that will benefits them.  And that is all it!\n\nby the way, why should they eat the dog, anyway?there're lots of animals to be eaten, yet healthier and taste better for sure!1	find an equation for the hyperbola with focus (11,2), and asymptotes 4x-3=18 and 4x+3y=30.?  First, Plot all the points on a graph.\nThe Focus is (11, 2).\nNow, Plot the 2 asymptotes.\nThis can be done by substituting, x=0 to find y then y=0 to find x.\nThe first one is a line crossing (0,-6) and (4.5,0)\nThe second one is a line crossing (0,10) and (7.5,0).\n\nNow with these lines and the focus, you will see that the hyperbola opens to the right.\n\n---\n\nThe equation is:\n{[(x-h)^2]/(a^2)} - {[(y-k)^2]/(b^2)} = 1\n\nwith the equations of the asymptotic lines as:\ny - k = +/- (b/a)(x - h)\n\n-----\nSo the 2 asymptotes equation will give,\ny = 4x/3 - 6 and y = -4x/3 + 10\n\nHence, b=4, a=3\nSolving for h, k\n\nk - 4h/3 = -6\nk + 4h/3 = 10\nNow, 2k = 4, this k = 2.  Giving h = 6\n\n--- The equation is \n{[(x-6)^2]/(3^2)} - {[(y-2)^2]/(4^2)} = 13	Ive enrolled for a beauty course at Leicester college but before i get in they will give me an interview.?

US-Hisory to 1877 The Intolerable Acts, called by the British the Coercive Acts or Punitive Acts, were a series of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 in response to the growing unrest in thirteen American colonies, particularly in Boston, Massachusetts after incidents such as the Boston Tea Party. Enforcement of the Acts played a major role in the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War and the establishment of the First Continental Congress.\nThis British cartoon, depicting the acts as asaults upon an anthropomorphic Boston, was quickly copied and distributed by Paul Revere to all the colonies. \n\nThe Coercive Acts included:\n\n    * Massachusetts Government Act\n    * Administration of Justice Act\n    * Boston Port Act\n    * Quartering Act\n\nThe Quebec Act was also passed in 1774, but it was a piece of legislation unrelated to the Coercive Acts. American Whigs, however, were alarmed by the Quebec Act as much as the Coercive Acts, and they labeled it one of the "Intolerable Acts". Their main complaints over the Quebec Act were the protections granted to the Indian territories and to the Catholic settlers in Ohio. These were viewed as attempts to halt expansion into the west and to strengthen a church that many opposed.\n\nThe acts had several different effects. They unintentionally promoted sympathy for the revolutionaries in Massachusetts, and encouraged revolutionaries from the otherwise diverse colonies to band together. However, the Quebec Act had the opposite effect among French Catholics in the Province of Quebec, encouraging many of them to either pragmatic inaction or support for the Crown.4	how do i copy a DVD to my computer hard disk?  use dvdshrink0	Is This a Coincidence or SOMETHING ELSE?

They are all part of the Church of England, right?\nAre there any major doctrinal differences?\nWho are their heads? The world wide church is called the Anglican Church. Each country has its own branch, and in the U.S. that is called the Episcopalian, which means governed by Bishops. In the U.K. is it called the Church of England. They are all part of the same "Anglican Communion". The head of the Episcopal church is called the Presiding Bishop. The head of the whole Anglican Church is the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. He does not have the same position in the Anglican Church as the Pope does in the Roman Church because the Anglican Church is run as more of a democracy.3	What is the ending of hoot by carl hiaasen?

Vrat is fasting in Hindism. They obseve fasting for various reasons.Fasting is a very integral part of the Hindu religion. Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on personal beliefs and local customs. Some are listed below-\n\n- Some Hindus fast on certain days of the month such as Ekadasi (the eleventh day of each lunar fortnight) or Purnima (full moon). \n- Certain days of the week are also set aside for fasting depending on personal belief and favorite deity. \n- Fasting during religious festivals is also very common. Common examples are Shivaratri or the 9 days of Navratri (which occurs twice a year in the months of April and October/November during Dussera just before Diwali, as per the Hindu Calendar). Karwa Chauth is perhaps a form of fasting unique to the northern part of India where married women undertake a fast for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The Fast is broken after the wife views the moon through a sieve after sunset. \n\n- Methods of fasting also vary widely and cover a broad spectrum. If followed strictly, the person fasting does not partake any food or water from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day and/or abstaining from eating certain food types and/or eating only certain food-types. In any case, even if the fasting Hindu is non-vegetarian, he/she is not supposed to eat or even touch any animal products (i.e. meat, eggs) on a day of fasting.\n\nOthr religions like, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, Jews also observe fasting due to certian religious beliefs of their own.-1	What came first, the fruit or the color orange?

Are Grades necassary part of education? if grades are not necessary, how would you determine the student aptitude or capability? should we keep the system as is or make some change? Schools are rethinking meritocracy, but maybe not in ways you think. This is an interesting time to be an educator in the US because there are at least two different paradigm shifts happening in education right now. Those two changes are happening in opposite directions, which leave teachers twisted into impossible contortions.\n\nIn the universities, teachers are being trained to understand that each student is an individual with different strengths and weaknesses. They are being taught to recognize the different multiple intelligences (interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily/kinesthetic, musical/rhythmic, naturalistic, visual/spatial, verbal, mathematical/logical) and learning styles of children. Teachers are learning to honor and make use of cultural differences as well in the learning experiences and opportunities to demonstrate knowledge they create in their classroom. \n\nNew educators are learning how important hands-on experiences are for young learners preparing to make the jump from concrete to abstract thinking. They are encouraged to let students run parent-teacher conferences by choosing samples of work to go in a portfolio and explaining to the parent exactly what each piece of the portfolio shows that they have learned. This will help students take ownership of the processes of learning and demonstrating their knowledge, and they will become self-directed learners. \n\nTeacher are working to create a learning community where students feel free to be take risks, be wrong, and tell each other what can make their projects better. Students are learning critical thinking skills by evaluating their own and each others' work. \n\nAll of this is happening along with a growing recognition that students have to build their own knowledge by connecting new facts and ideas to what they already know and what they are interested in. More and more teachers are seeing the value of individual projects that let a student make some creative decisions on their own and lead to a finished product that they themselves judge to be of good quality. \n\nAt the same time, politicians have gotten involved in education. There is a growing movement some call the Cult of Accountabilism. This means that politicians want to hold schools accountable for what they are teaching. The methods of accountability states have devised are not very creative--chiefly fill-in-the-bubble tests of verbal and mathematical skills. \n\nThere are severe punishments for schools that fail to raise test scores under the federal No Child Left Behind law. I've seen reductions in funding and many extra meetings with consultants who are hired to raise test scores. I've also seen a district gradually choke off funding and then fire the principal and all the teachers at schools that fail to perform. The district leadership hires a new staff and pumps extra money into the school, taking credit when test scores go up. \n\nThose pressures mean grades will be around at most schools for a long time to come. At the same time, many states in the US are changing report cards to something that parents will need to learn to understand. It's called a standards-based report card.\n\nUsed to be, you got grades that reflected some kind of weighted percentage of the assignments, questions, problems you successfully completed. Those that were given to you reflected a teacher's idea of what students in that grade and that subject should be able to do. There might be a very complicated letter sent home with the formula that showed how the grades for homework, tests, and other assignments were combined. \n\nNow states have lists of content standards and benchmarks that represent what students in different grades and different subjects should be able to do. \n\n"Students will be able to correctly add numbers of three digits, with regrouping." \n"Students will be able to write a persuasive essay with three supporting arguments." \n"Students will demons9	What's the average time span between an event and when the political Left starts lying about that event?

Probably the best way to know if a guy likes you is to simply ask him, but we all know that can be a challenge. So, here are a few clues to working out if he likes you as much as you like him. \n\nSteps \nExamine his body language. If he likes you, you will see that his body position will lean forward toward you. \nKeep close. Ever get the feeling that somebody is "in" your personal space - so much so that you want to step back? If he likes you and you like him, neither of you will step back. \nMake eye contact - if he likes you, he'll get it and hold it. Again, this can be uncomfortable if you don't like him or vice versa. You'll know if you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly. \nBe aware of touching - he might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, or not move his leg if it happens to touch yours. This is a very good sign that he likes you. \nKeep an eye out. His pupils will dilate (get bigger) if he likes you - but this is quite hard to pick up on and you might look a bit weird looking that closely into his eyes. \nSee if he keeps going out of his way to 'bump' into you. \nWatch for him showing interest in things you like and do. \nJoke freely. Does he laugh even if you aren't funny? \nCheck for signs of nervousness: nervous laughter, sweaty palms, fidgeting... \nSmile. A big smile in return probably means the feeling is mutual. \nSee if he always end up in the same line or group as you. \n\nTips \nDoes he make an extra effort to be around you in certain situations (dances, school, etc)? That could be a sign. \nHis friends might often ask you how you feel about him. \nChances are, if your stomach does a flip flop when you see him, his may be doing the same. \nSmile, be yourself, and let biology and fate work their charms. \nYou can always ask a friend to ask him - but that can backfire. \nYou can't really MAKE someone like you - but the best way to be noticed is to be true to yourself, feel good about yourself and never do anything you don't want to do to get someone's affection. \nThink about how you act when you like someone and look for those signs in others. \n\nWarnings \nDon't spend too long trying to find out or you may look like a stalker and this will also backfire.5	what is pele's real name? he is still regarded as the best in world football and is from brazil.

Hello Catherine, Your question is a very good one.Now,in the first molecule OF 2, all the valence electrons are used up in bonding and it forms a stable molecule having linear geometry. In the second molecule SCL 2 the same is happening and the molecule is linear in geometry.But, in the last one that is PF 5, the three valence electrons of Phosphorus are used up in bonding with Fluorine electrons,leaving two  electrons of Phosphorus as Lone-pairs,as a  result the molecule has a distorted geometry and the molecule has a Pyramidral shape like that of NH 3.

If you're referring to an actual bolt of lightening striking your computer, then yes, you would be electrocuted if you were touching it. If you're talking about a power surge, then it's possible, if you aren't grounded, that you could be shocked or even electrocuted. It's wise to turn off and unplug as many electronics as you can in a lightening storm.0	At what point do we forgive, as individuals, as a nation, as a world family? America apologized for slavery, Germany apologized for the Holocaust. Countries have been brought to task over their wrong doings through out history. \n\nSo at what point should we expect victims of such crimes to forgive? \n\nShould it be never or should it be when that generation has past? \n\nOf course one should never forget! We should learn from those times so we do not repeat those horrors. However, when is it time to forgive those responsible, to forgive those nations, to forgive the world?\n\nAt what point must victims move on so progress can be made? I don't believe forgiveness is necessarily REQUIRED or that it is even possible for all people to accomplish.  But it often can be beneficial in helping 'victims' cope and carry on with their lives.  While I say that, I myself have never (yet) been able to forgive my father for abusing my sister and I'm not sure I ever will.  But I have learned to accept it I suppose.  \n\nI don't know.  Tough question.  Very hard to forgive some transgressions, that's for darn sure.4	Do You have the code for the Luxor game?  search on www.crackspider.net\n\nGood luck.5	who is your rookie of the year nl and al i know it is early i wanna see how many people actually follow baseba ll C.

Right now I'm able to do 30 crunches without stopping and then I switch to pushups which I can do 20. Then I repeat this 5 tmes. Should I contunue to do this also? For your legs:  biking, jogging, elliptical trainer, squats, dancing, kicking, stair climbing though not TOO much as you don't want bulging muscles.  They should just become firmer with all that exercise.\n\nFor your stomach:  Continue with the crunches but when you come up, turn to one side then down, then come up and turn to the other side. That will help develop your 'oblique' muscles in your abdominal section.\n\n Also, while you're on the floor, lift your head, put your hands behind your neck and lift your legs with your knees bent.  Now move your legs like you're pedalling a bike and alternate pointing your right elbow to your left knee when it's up, then your left elbow to your right knee.  \n\nKeep up the good work with the pushups but remember that your arms have other muscles so lift heavy objects and pull too.4	First was tape what do you think come after CD?  dvd2	Is this considered petrol sniffing?

Don't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on. I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!4	What can I do my website on?

Iraq has made a four year high of 3 billion dollars in oil, money Saddam would have used to build more palaces. The Iraqi forces are starting to do whole operations by themselves. They got there government up and running in about 2 years. It took us about 5. Yes, soldiers are dying, and yes it is sad that they are, but we are giving these people and the people in the middle east hope. There will always be those people over there saying they hate us, but that is not the majority. I am sick and tired of everybody thinkink that we are evil for being in Iraq and saying it is a failure when it is not. So shut up. It will take longer than 4 years to rebuild a country. Here are some thoughts as to why.  People listen to the media, which is liberal, and anti-bush.  People don't like to learn from history, and remember how hard it was to get what we have in America, and that it is mostly due to the wars we fought, died, and bled for.  Soldiers have always died in war, and this is no different.  It is no surprise to them, or their families.  They KNOW it can happen, and still happily go.  They LOVE their country, and lots of Americans cannot understand, or appreciate it.  I agree completely with you.  It is NOT a failure, and I hope that you realize not as many say that as you are hearing.   The media just WANTS you to think it is all bad.  Keep speaking truth, and sharing what you know.3	Hi can anyone please translate this, I think it might me in Polish? omaly,ch lapkach,Nie wiemi nie kumam, dlaczego,ale smetnie\nmi yest z powjda Two jego wyjazdu, AnAwet bardzo, Albo  jeszcze ,bardziej\nTO Chcialem wyarty kuawac by srode ale nie dalem rady moz,e przez maila dam\nrade choc   nie wien czy podolam.

Many, many times I have told my husband about how I feel about porno but, he still looks at it when I am not around. Am I not appealing to his eyes anymore?

I would say he is still attracted to you. if he becomes an addict, you may run into problems. if he catalogs it and has his favorites he is an addict. which still doesn't mean he isn't attracted to you , he has an addiction like any other drug. it like an escape from the dreary life that binds him. it's fantasy.2	What are some virulence factors that may enable an infectious disease to gain entry via the skin? placenta?  acne1	What kind of bonds does silver have?

While it is true that biological and early childhood experiences can do much to shape one's future, the best way to known one's future to take a good look at one's past and one's present. Those things you take forgranted, habits in your behavior and your thinking, openess or lack of openess to new ways of thinking and doing things....these are the things that shape your "fate" and/or "destiny". \n\nSo, I would have to say no, if you mean by these terms fate as something predetermined by some supernatural agency beyond my control. On the other hand, I would say yes, if you mean those things that I am unwilling to examine and change for the better within myself.  This argument, however, fails to acknowledge the things beyond one's control: for example, if you're born into an impoverished family with poor nutrition, no access to education or to financial gain, and in a country that is torn by war... then the field of choices available to you may be greatly limited. A choice that is impossible or greatly limited in your environment is not really a choice then.  Nonetheless, even within a limited field of choice, there are some choices that are better than others, if you can just see them and make them and make the best of whatever life you have. Therefore, the power is always with you to change the course of your life even if only slightly...so the final answer is No, I don't believe in fate or destiny.7	How can I find the move Shaharazar which stars Susan Hayward or Maureen O'Hara?

How many coins did each have originally? \n\nShow work and use only one variable Let Q = the number of quarters Quincy has.  They are worth 25Q cents.\n\nDirk has (Q+5) dimes worth 10(Q+5) cents = 10Q + 50 cents\n\nWhen Natalie gives Dirk a nickel he now has 10Q + 55 cents, but he then gives a dime to Quincy leaving Dirk with 10Q + 45 cents and Quincy with 25Q + 10 cents.\n\nFinally Quincy gives away a quarter leaving him with 25Q - 15 cents, which equals Dirk's money or 10Q + 45\n\n25Q - 15 = 10Q + 45\n\nSubtract 10Q from both sides: 15Q - 15 = 45\n\nYou can finish from here I am sure.9	Is anyone who enlists for active duty in the marines going straight to Iraq after bootcamp? also is their any hope of someone joining the marines right now and not coming home in a coffin or missing limbs? seriously...like what are the odds of that?\n\nas you all probably can tell i have a friend who has enlisted in the marines and he has chosen to be an infantryman...i know jack spit about the military and i dont like to ask him because he knows that i dont want him to go...but anyways yeah... Heck no.  Once your buddy finishes basic training they'll send him off to another base where he'll learn how to be an infantryman.  There is a possibility that he could be sent to Iraq after that, but it's POSSIBLE, not DEFINITE.\n\nP.S.:  The vast majority of men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces who have served in Iraq (better than 98%) have come back alive, in one piece, without any debilitating injuries or loss of limbs.  Yes, being an American soldier in Iraq is dangerous, and there's always a chance that your friend could be sent to Iraq and could die there, but don't believe the garbage being spit out by the mainstream media.  They want you to think that going to Iraq is a death sentence for every soldier that has to go, and it's simply not true.  BOTTOM LINE:  Yes, your friend could get sent over to the sandbox and he could end up dead or maimed, but chances are he'll do his time (if he even has to) and come back no worse for wear.7	how to download songs from www.smashhits.com to my computer harddisk ? in other sites, there is a download mark where we can click and download a song but here i am unable to find the download mark. u cant download songs 4 rm http://www.smashits.com ....... instead u can watch & listen to videos & songs0	Has anyone seen a demon with their own eyes?

Sometimes I am so lazy to study, especially in the mornings. Sometimes the energy comes in the evening and then I study until night, its also not very good solution to study at night and be so exhausted at class next day. What are the most productive study hours ? The most effective study hours are when you are most alert.  For most people, this will be more than an hour after your last meal, not too late in the day or too early.  For me, this is from 9-12 AM, and from 1-4 PM.  If you must study other times, my advice is to change the WAY you study.  The most effective way to study is the way that makes the content interesting to you.  Find something about it that you are interested in, or a reason why you can be motivated to learn it.  Also, if you learn best by reading, read the content.  If you learn best by listening, tape the lecture and listen to it again.8	when i try to sign in it like smiles for like 3 seconds then does the sleep face and doesnt letme in watdo ido like after i put my name in ..... your computer has a virus of sorts, called a trojan horse that is preventing sign in to yahoo...you should get a good virus checking program, load it and clean the system completely...it will fix the problem, I have fixed others computers that users had that had similar problems, the virus uses your sign on/mail account to spam other computers but does not give you access to it so you cant see what it is doing.6	which number represent your visa number?

I have a not so severe cold meaning i get runny nose once in a while but i do see to be cold at times n hot at other times, y is this happening?? is a way for the body to fight off infections?? or am i just understanding this all wrong!! While some of the above answers have slight truths to them…these are the anatomic (real medical) reasons why this happens.  Everything you described happens because when you get an infection, our body naturally tries to fight it off.  \n\nWhen we get a fever our bodies try to kill the infection by turning up our internal temperature.  Bacteria and viruses cannot live at high temps and are killed by our fever.  This is when we feel hot.  \n\nOur bodies respond by shivering to raise the temperature. Shivering produces heat in the body. Once the temperature goes up, we start to feel warm. When the fever goes away, that is when we sweat\n\nYou get a runny nose, because your body decides to make extra mucus in order to “wash” away any bacteria that could get trapped in your sinuses.\n\nI hoped that helped...I tried to get to the point and not be so “wordy”2	I so wanna get pregnant but im goin on 40n this year...i knw im risking do u think its worth the risk?

Consider  miles and miles long wire.\nEstimated wrt speed of sound/ light In a real wire, the velocity is something less than the speed of light.  How much less depends on the permitivity and permiability of the medium that the wave is propagating through.  What you want to find out is the "Velocity Factor" or "Velocity of Propagation" of your wire.  \nAs an example, standard RG6A Coax cable has a velocity factor of 0.66, which means that electricity travels through it at 66% of the speed of light.\nHere is a list with example velocities of propagation for different wire types\nhttp://www.nteinc.com/jovial/shortstop/voplist.html1	physics help?

I have known this man for over 20 years. We used to date when we were younger. I am separated and soon to be divorced and he has just recently filed for a divorce. We have started seeing each other and are very much in love. He tells me he has often thought of me and I the same of him but never persued each other because we always thought the other was happy.Come to find out we were both very unhappy in our marriages to other people.I am just so scared he will end up going back to her but he promises me he won't that he wants and needs to be with me. I could not handle getting hurt again.I truly love this man with all my heart. Could this actually be what I have always dreamed it to be or is this something that has happened on the rebound?

Hi,\nAVG is one of the best; available from http://www.grisoft.com. The free version is good. I bought the "buy" version for 33 dollars US for two years. Use to have Norton, but uninstalled it, like AVG much, much better. There are "definitions" downloads almost every day. They do not wait to put them in one large file, like every two weeks. You can download them when they are ready, like 2 or 3 at the time.\nI highly recommend AVG; works great on any windows system.0	Atheists:  What about agnostics that bothers you so much? Hoping for civil responses---even if agreement isn't the goal, I do wish to know your opinions better on this matter. :-)  I know of only two reasons why atheists seem to dislike "agnostic":  it tends to make the word "atheist" sound worse than it really is;  and agnostics are quote "wimping out" by taking this position.  Yes, I have been personally berated by some atheists before.  I am hoping two atheists I have queried about this will respond too.  :-D\n\n1)  What is it exactly about agnostics, agnosticism and the term "agnostic" that bothers you so much?\n\n2)  Why?  What are the underlying reasons?\n\n3)  If there is another term you think is better than agnostic, then please share and I will 'Yahoo' it. Hi.\n\nI don't really have a problem with agnostics, but, then again, it all comes down to your definition of the word. If "agnostic" means someone who is skeptical about god, but not quite able to say "There is no god!" I'm fine with that. I'm very much up in the air about a lot of issues and even have opposing viewpoints about some things. It's fine to not be able to come to a hard opinion about certain things.\n\nThe issue that I do have is when agnosticism means: "The existence of god is unknowable." I just can't buy that explanation. From where I sit, everything is knowable. We may not have the tools to find the answer, or even the mental software to grasp the answer, but this doesn't mean that it is "unknowable."\n\nNow, I don't think I have a better term than "agnostic," but I do know that there has been some backlash lately (not here) from certain people who feel that people like me (hard-atheist/skeptics) have co-opted the term "skeptic" and taken away its "actual" meaning (which closely means "examiner," as opposed to "loud-mouthed nay-sayer.") These people are trying to reestablish a more traditional school of skepticism under the name zetecism (closely meaning "seekers.)\n\nSo, I don't know. Do some research and you might find that you're actually a Zetetic. I realize that it can be a difficult thing for a young woman to learn that she is actually a member of an ancient Greek school of thinking that the majority of people on Earth have never heard of, but it is a rite of passage that we must all go through. :)9	what can be done about our ports being turned over to aforeign country? i know the british had our shipping ports before, but why now, with all the terroists , we don't know who is friend or foe! Well, first off, it's important to make sure any deal is carefully vetted (and this one was, both by the Committee on Foreign Investment as well as U.S. intelligence).  Second, it should be noted that though the UAE has had problems with money-laundering by terrorists, and 2 of the 9/11 hijackers were from there, is actually an ally of the U.S.  They did give us a base from which to stage the invasion of Iraq, the UAE has given major support to U.S. and other Western intelligence services, and U.S. ships make port calls to Dubai all the time -speaking of which, the same company who oversees operations at the port(s) is the very same company now attempting to take over managing of the ports here in the U.S.  If they wanted to do any serious damage, they could have already done so with some of our warships.\n\nHowever, it's more important to realize that actual *ownership* of the ports will remain the port authorities of each city/region.  Security will still be their responsibility, as well as that of U.S. Customs & the Coast Guard.  All Dubai Ports World will do is take over day-to-day running of the operations.  So, really, nobody is actually turning our ports over to anyone.  As it is, most of our ports are *already* run by other countries.  And most maritime security experts have already stated that the management of the ports by DPW won't actually mean a breach of security, unless the Port Authorities decide to slack off.\n\nJust because it's an Arab country doesn't mean it's automatically an enemy.  Sure, such countries can expect more of a vetting than a company from Britain or France, but, really, it's ludicrous to ban a country simply because of the acts (however terrible) of some of its citizens.  Otherwise, we'd have to ban every country in the world -including ourselves.  Remember Jose Padilla or John Walker Lindh?\n\nAll the fuss is really about is the complaints of the longshoremen's unions, who are afraid of possibly losing their jobs.  Now, while I can totally accept that as a valid concern, there has to be a balance point between "run this company/entity as profitably as possible" and "don't do ANYTHING new, because otherwise we might end up being replaced by computers".\n\nPoliticians on both sides talk of "the need to win the hearts and minds of the Arab people".  If we ban this company on the basis of being from an Arab country, without any thought as to what the country is actually like, what does that really say about the U.S.?5	How many tikets are being sold for the 2006 FIFA World cup?  450,0571	what is the sun?  a star6	bonus share?  Bonus shares are shares given to existing shareholders usually based on a particular ratio. The shareholders need not pay for such shares. The company will decrease their distributable reserves and increase their paid up capital.\nTo the shareholders, receiving bonus shares represents a return on their investment. But unlike dividends, bonus shares are usually tax-free. The end result is that the shareholder will now own more shares in the company.1	Are we really made of Space dust?  if so, then what is keeping us intact as physical bodies? Is it our conditioned thoughts? that notion came from Carl Sagan, the author of the novel "Contact" that was later made into a movie starring Jodie Foster. Now in the book what he actually said was "we are made of starstuff". He meant that we are made of what stars are made of, as is anything else in the universe. Meaning we all things in the universe are made of basic chemical or even atomical components that are common to everything in the most basic level. It was not meant to be perceived as "if i cut my arm off and grind it up to very small pieces it will turn into space dust".4	what is hardware accelator card? when i try to play midtown madness game on my win 98 celeron pc, a message appear that it is trying to locate hardware accelator card and it fails to play Midtown Madness won't load unless you have a separate video card.

Tensile strength measures the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks.\n\nSpecifically, the tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can be subjected to before failure. The definition of failure can vary according to material type and design methodology. This is an important concept in engineering, especially in the fields of material science, mechanical engineering and structural engineering.\n\nThere are three typical definitions of tensile strength:\n\n    * Yield strength - The stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation.\n\n    * Ultimate strength - The maximum stress a material can withstand.\n\n    * Breaking strength - The stress coordinate on the stress-strain curve at the point of rupture.1	What's the deal with spontaneous combustion????

Give four pieces of evidence that a large impact occurred at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Sorry, this is kinda long but stick with me. I studied this at uni so its a really interesting topic for me. If you dont like it blame my lecturers. \n\n70% of all life including the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago at what is known as the K-T Event. The current theory which is known to be the best explanation for this to happen is that a large meteor roughly 10 kilometres in diameter collided with the Earth changing the climate at the time drastically as dust and ash clouded the sky blocking out the sun. At the same time fires raged around the planet as forests caught fire from the intense heat. Now that thats all cleared up lets get down to it.\n\n1) In 1990 a scientist called Alan Hildebrand was looking over some old geophysical data that had been recorded by a group of geophysicists searching for oil in the Yucatan region of Mexico. Within the data he found evidence of what could have been an impact site. What he found was a ring structure 180km in diameter which was called Chicxulub. The location of this structure was just off the northwest tip of the Yucatan Peninsula. The crater has been dated as being 65 million years old\n\n2) In 1980 scientists called Walter and Luis Alvarez wrote a paper on a 1cm layer of clay they had discovered in Gubbio which is in Italy at what was known to be the zone that marked the time the dinosaurs became extinct. This layer was found to be rich in a rare element called Iridium ( Ir ). \n\nThe presence of this element in much greater abundance than would be normally expected caused great confusion. Most of the Earth's store of Ir has been concentrated into the centre of the planet. They found the Iridium levels to be 160 times higher that would normally present. This much Iridium could not have occured naturally. The only way this amount if Ir could have occured is from an asteroid or comet.\n\n3) Quartz is a mineral made from Silica ( pure sand ) and has a structure that can be deformed if it undergoes high pressures. The high velocity impact of a meteor would not only create extreme levels of heat, but also high pressures. The type of pressure applied by an impact causes what is known as shock metamorphism, this deforms the structure of the quartz and creates parallel laminar ripples. This form of quartz has been found around the world and is a very strong argument for the meteor in two respects:\n\n-It is found all over the world, not just locally.\n\n-No other process on the planet creates this type of quartz.\n\n 4) Certain conditions favour certain elements and so if we examine the ratios of elements we can often identify a pattern that tells us what the conditions were. Meteorites have this 'fingerprint' and a characteristic set of elemental ratios. The ratios of elements found in the boundary layers of the impact suggest that it came from outside the earth.\n\nHope this helped0	SO!

Calling your pharmacy for a question like this may or may not be very effective since most pharmacists have not committed generic drug tablet imprints to memory (they've got enough stuff to memorize, believe me).  If they don't have access to a drug imprint database (most dont), you're really out of luck with them....\n\nAnyhoo, I couldn't find this specific number but other drugs with a similar description (different number 4###) were all ibuprofen.  So, this med is probably also ibuprofen.  However, I wouldn't take it or give it to anyone under the presumption that it is ibuprofen.  Judging from the fact that this  number didn't turn up, I would say it may have been discontinued and therefore it may be expired.  It may or may not be prescription since low dose ibuprofen (200 mg) is over-the-counter and high dose (>=400 mg) is prescription.5	In what year did the USA score it's first world cup victory, who was the opponent and what was the score?

If I am 19, have never had a credit card before, have never been in debt, don't really have a credit record (I presume), am planning to pay off my balance every month, and am planning to use it for online purchases? \nHow can I compare interest rates, etc? What are some good questions to ask when getting a credit card? First, I'd suggest going to one of the credit bureaus websites and ordering a credit score. This will let you know where you stand as far as credit rating, which affects the interest rates available to you. It might be difficult not having much of a credit history to get an unsecured card, so I'd recommend finding a financial institution that offers a secured card. You secure the card by giving the bank money equal to the credit limit you want. They hold it for you in "escrow" so if you don't pay your bills, they withdraw the amount you didn't pay. \n\nInterest rate doesn't really matter if you pay off your balance each month, but its very easy to carry a balance and I speak from experience. You can shop for credit cards at sites like bankrate.com and cardweb.com. Good luck!4	How do I safely clean an LCD computer screen?  Alcohol and soft cloth.

I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries, and after a year, the cysts have not gone away.  My gynecologist said that if the cysts still do not go away by the time of my next visit (six months), we should seriously consider laparoscopy.  \nI'm confused about an ovarian laparoscopy.  The way it was explained to me, I think my doctor just wanted to look.  I read online that laparoscopy is used just to see.  However, I have also read that if an abnormality is seen, such as a cyst, the doctor will drain them.  Also, is this what is called "ovarian drilling"?  I heard that if I develop scar tissue, I will not be able to get pregnant.  What are the chances that I will be scarred?  Lastly, would this be for both ovaries?  \nThank you. Polycysitic ovaries, or PCOS is a complex condition that to this day has no clear cut situations. But first as off let me address your possibilities of not being able to fall pregnant. This is not always the case. Your presonal situation will be different to every other woman with PSOC, so this is something only you and your doctor can discuss, however, more and more women who suffer from PCOS are falling pregnant. If you are in a relationship and are looking ot fall pregnant, then there are many things medically that can be done to assist, however some women dont need assistance at all.\n\nSecondly, a Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a "laparoscope" via a key hole inscision to send a camera to your ovaries to have a look.  Your Doctor may or may not remove cysts that he sees, as depending of the size and the nature of the cyst, they can often disappear over time. If he does chose to remove the cyst, it generally can be done through the same key hole inscision. \n\nAlso, ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment.\n\nOne thing I wish to say to you is never follow 'things you have heard' as gospel for your own health. Only a health professional who knows your medical history should make calls on your personal situation. \n\nBut I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.\n\nGood Luck, and your situation isnt as uncommon as you may believe and all you have to do is ask a few other woman, and chances are, one of them will have PCOS too.6	What is a custodian in financial banking terms?  Custodian as a financial term, refers to a bank (Custodian bank), agent, or other organization responsible for safeguarding a firm's or individual's financial assets. The role of a custodian in such a case would be the following: to hold in safekeeping assets such as equities and bonds, arrange settlement of any purchases and sales of such securities, collect information on and income from such assets (dividends in the case of equities and interest in the case of bonds), provide information on the underlying companies and their annual general meetings, manage cash transactions, perform foreign exchange transactions where required and provide regular reporting on all their activities to their clients. \nCustodian banks are often referred to as Global Custodians if they hold assets for their clients in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks in each market to hold accounts for their underlying clients. Assets held in such a manner are typically owned by pension funds.4	where can i find an england flag myspace layout?  go to a search engine and search for an english flag and upload it on www.photobucket.com or www.tinypic.com then go to a search engine and search for myspace layout generator and once you get your link from when you uploaded your picture put it in the layout generator and copy the code and paste it into your about me section on myspace.2	My girlfriend is depressed, how do I get her out of her rut?  Honor her feelings, don't see them as a problem that needs to be fixed. Ask her what makes her feel good.

Interordinal mammalian relationships: Evidence for paenungulate monophyly is provided by complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences \nLavergne A, Douzery E, Stichler T, Catzeflis FM, Springer MS \nMOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION 6 (2): 245-258 OCT 1996 \nCited References: 66      Times Cited: 37        \nAbstract: The complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences of 5 placental mammals belonging to the 3 orders Sirenia (Sea Cow), Proboscidea (Elephant), and Hyracoidea (Hyrax) are reported together with phylogenetic analyses (distance and parsimony) of a total of 51 mammalian orthologues. This 12S rRNA database now includes the 2 extant proboscideans (the African and Asiatic elephants Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus), 2 of the 3 extant sirenian genera (the sea cow Dugong dugon and the West Indian manatee Trichechus manatus), and 2 of the 3 extant hyracoid genera (the rock and tree hyraxes Procavia capensis and Dendrohyrax dorsalis). The monophyly (close relatedness) of the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea is supported by all kinds of analysis. There are 23 and 3 diagnostic subsitutions shared by the 2 proboscideans and the 2 hyracoids, respectively, but none by the 2 sirenians. The 2 proboscideans exhibit the fastest rates of 12S rRNA evolution among the 11 placental orders studied. Based on various taxonomic sampling methods among eutherian orders and marsupial outgroups, the most strongly supported clade in our comparisons clusters together the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea in the superorder Paenungulata. Within paenungulates, the grouping of sirenians and proboscideans within the mirorder Tethytheria is observed. This branching pattern is supported by all analyses by high bootstrap percentages (BPs) and decay indices. When only one species is selected per order or suborder, the taxonomic sampling leads to a relative variation in bootstrap support of 53% for Tethytheria (BPs ranging from 44 to 93%) and 7% for Paernungulata (92-99%). When each order or suborder is represented by two species, this relative variation decreased to 10% for Tethytheria (78-87%) and 3% for Paenungulata (96-99%). Two nearly exclusive synapomorphies for paenungulates are identified in the form of one transitional compensatory change, but none were detected for tethytherians. Such a robust and reliable resolution of the paenungulate node implies a long history of the common ancestors, allowing time for synapomorphies to accumulate. This observation suggests a Late Cretaceous/Early Paleocene origin for the Paenungulata.1	A water dispenser for pets has an inverted plastic bottle.? When a certain amount of water is drunk from the bowl, more water flows automatically from the bottle into the bowl. The bowl never overflows. Explain the operation of the dispenser. Does the height of the water in the bottle depend on the surface area of the water in the bowl? In a vacuum (assuming the water didn't boil) the water level of the bowl and the bottle would be equal. However, the air pressure on the water in the bowl pushes the water up and back into the bottle. It's a constant battle between gravity and air pressure, which is determined by the surface area of the water in the bowl.4	IDA lines?

Using nitrogen gas at a temp of 30 deg c and charging a cylinder of a fixed volume of 1000 ltrs/cm3 what is the extra mass/volume of gas required to increase the pressure in side the cylinder from 3400psi 3600psi as pressure is directly proportional to density. so for fixed volume pressure is directly proportional to mass so\np1/p2 = m1/m2\np1=3400 p2=3600 m1= 1000 ltrs m2=x\nso we find m2=1058.82 ltrs\nso we need 58.82 ltrs convert into kgs\nby finding density of nitrogen gas.\nhope this helps4	define image mode in photoshop cs?

How much does this procedure cost and can it be covered by insurance if the condition makes sex painful?  How do I go about finding a good surgeon? I have heard that this causes extreme loss of sensation.  Much like a man who gets circumcised as an adult.  Look into it a lot before you make a decision.  Oh and look at a text book (like college style) on sexuality so you can see how other women look.  You will probably be surprised how normal you are.  And by the way, I don't know a single woman who thinks her labia is pretty.9	OK last Q: Why do people get so offended at people flying other flags? I agree ours should be flown on top or at first but when they do why do you all get so upset? It is so minute to me. I don't get offended.  If you want to fly the flag of another country, this is the land of the free, go for it.  I probably will get a bunch of thumbs down for this opinion, but if you think about it, flying a flag of another country is not showing disrespect for America.  It is showing pride in where they came from, but not disrespect of America.  I was born and bred here in the US.  I can trace back my lines to my american Indian heritage, and also to my English heritage.  However, my husband is from Honduras.  I, not him, but me, bought a Honduras flag, and it is hanging in our children's room.  I also bought one of those flags that go onto the windshield of our car - and it was a Honduras flag.  But that doesn't mean that I am showing any disrespect for America.1	Help with Trigonometry? Using the periodic properties of trigonometric functions, find the exact value of the expression: \n\ntan 17pi\n\ncos 8pi/3 Use the fact that angles are the same every 2pi .... in other words 0 = 2pi = 4pi etc., and pi = 3pi = 5pi, etc.  This is because 2pi is the complete rotation of a circle, or 360 degrees.\n\nSo, 17pi is simply the same angle as pi.\n\nSo, tan 17pi = tan pi = 0\n\nSimilarly, 8pi/3 = 8pi/3 - 6pi/3 = 2pi/3\n\nSo, cos 8pi/3 = cos 2pi/3 = -1/2\n\n~ ♥ ~3	What is the grammatically correct pluralized form of the word 'sushi'? Please cite reliable references. e.g., "What are some of your favorite sush___?"\n\nI, myself, like California rolls. Personally, I would reword the statement to prevent the plural of the word "sushi" (which is also "sushi")  from sounding awkward. \n"What are some of your favorite sushi dishes?"\n\nContradictions may emerge when foreign words are used in English - as is increasingly the case in the age of globalization. When Latin words were incorporated into English, such as octopi, they retained their foreign purity. Therefore, precedent stipulates that sushi should retain its Japanese purity. In practice: one sushi, two sushi, three sushi. The main problem with this second option is that it plays havoc with the cognitive patterns that the brain uses to code language.8	my boyfriend and i need your advise? we have been together for seven years but only lived together for a short time. the problem is, is our schedules are very differet, so we go to bed at different times. I go to bed early and then he wakes me up when he comes to bed around three am. i am a horrible sleeper, once i am up, i am up. there is no falling back to sleep. well last night i did not feel good and he knew that. he woke me up and i got very angry at him and yelled, so did he. he is threatening to go buy a cot to sleep on in the spare room. My question to you guys is how do you think having seperate bedrooms is going to effect our relationship? My husband and I had this exact same problem (with the different sleep schedules that is).  I would of course for the longest time get upset and sometimes it would even lead to us being up for another couple of hours fighting about it.  We eventually talked about it like adults and agreed it just wasn't worth the fighting.  (Plus, he has to sleep with the t.v. on and I love having complete quiet/darkness).  In the end I decided I would just lay there until I fell back asleep.  A little bit more sleep is better than none at all once I'm awake.  Over the years I've grown accustomed to it and it's just habit to roll over, cuddle up to him, and watch whatever movie he puts on until I drift back off.  But you two sleeping in separate rooms will definitely NOT solve the problem at all.  What I'm wondering right now is how does he wake you up?  Is he just too loud when he comes in or does he turn the light on?  If it's either one of these then maybe just ask him to be more understanding and try to not do these things when he's ready to come to bed.  If it's that he's turning on a light then maybe get a night light for the hallway or bathroom that'll help him see a little so he can walk in and lay down.2	Is there a Scientific Documentation from CDC that HIV does exist as of today, If there is Where?  http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/4	this message appears when i have installed win98 in my pc? "THIS PROGRAM HAS PERFORMED AN ILLEGAL OPERATION AND WILL BE SHUT DOWN, CONTACT THE PROGRAM VENDOR"\n\nwhat does this message mean and ask me to do with my pc. any solution please? Some type of installed software is failing.  It could be anything that you've installed, including the operating system.\n\nAre you saying you just recently installed win98 or it's always been there?  Whatever software change you made recently is likely the culprit.  It could be anything such as installing a game.  It could also be a corrupt DLL.  If you can figure out what program is causing it, you should reinstall that application to try to fix it.\n\nTry to narrow down the software that's causing the bug.  Start up in safe mode first, to make sure it isn't the operating system.  When you reboot the computer, press F8 continuously until the boot options menu comes up, then choose "Safe mode" or "safe mode with networking".  If it starts fine after that, then it's likely something other than Windows that's failing.5	whos gonna win big 12 north title? nebraska,kstate.iowa st,mizzu,colorado,kansas..

I am embarrassed to say I screwed up like 3 of them.  One I went to toss the money in and missed and just had no more change to put in the machine so I had to keep goin, one I wasn't aware that you couldn't put pennies in, and one on the way home just never said whether or not I could go!  I saw a phone number on a bunch of signs after that one saying if you had missed a toll to call this number, but as you're driving it's hard to read a sign and memorize the 800 number.  I was told that if you skip a toll they snap a picture of your car and send you a ticket for it.  Anyone know how I avoid that happening??  I don't know how much the tickets are for or what they do to your insurance but I don't want them!!  Thanks..... They do not allow three missed tolls a year, disregard the above answer.  You may be fined $31 for each toll missed.  Tolls are equipped and do take photos of your vehicle as you pass through.\n\nThe easiest way to pay the toll is to contact the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which covers both the Garden State Parkway and NJ Turnpike.  Their phone number is (732) 750-5300.\n\nThey will provide you with the correct means to pay for the missed tolls.9	Why do most reational people hate and not respect liberals?  I do not hate.

Some states allowed younger voting before it became national law to allow the 18 year old to vote, just as some states had allowed the Womens vote before it became National Law in 1920.  The first National Election that 18 year olds were able to vote in was in 1972 when Richard Nixon won a landslide victory over George McGovern.2	What is the best fat-burning supplement that is available over the counter?

Whats good about Mac OS X?I never used Mac OS X and I want to know why people use it, like what Mac OS X got that Windows(HP) dont got!! Mac OS X is such a stable OS for one. Compare it to WinXP and there are dozens of good things. First of all Apple computers do not have DOS. No applications use other applications to work well on Macs. If you want to delete a program on a Mac, you just delete it. No worry about it taking a part of another program with it. Each application is a stand alone program. Usually, DOS is the base for viruses, worms etc. Since Macs have no DOS, they don't get any of the viruses that PC's do. You don't need spyware; anti virus; tracking bug software to keep your computer safe and clean. It comes to you that way and it stays that way.\n Most Mac applications are extremely simple to use, even for the first time user. The stability of the Apple Computers is solid. Plus they are sure a lot of fun to operate. It's very hard to compare OS X 10.4 to MS XP as they are as different as apples and oranges. They both are computers and that is where the similaries end.1	a site other than google earth to get a detailed sharp aerial image of my property?  www.terraserver.com7	how many females inere have prominant hand veins that always stick out and never go back in the skin? this is a poll question i want to know how many females in here have prominat hand veins and if they like them yes or no i need more answer to this question Me and I like them, because they look like watch maker's hands, but if I stare at them too long I guess it's kind of gross.1	in the laboratory.you are reminded not to refill a hot alcoho lamp.explain the reason for this precaution.?

Both are required to complete an undergraduate degree -- usually with an emphasis on science -- followed by four years of medical school, and then a residency program. The length of this residency program varies by the physician's specialty. All physicians must then pass state licensure requirements and examinations.\n\nIn regard to primary care, the basic difference between these two types of doctors is narrowing all the time. "The biggest difference is that most DOs go into primary care", according to Bryan Beggin, DO, of the OSU Family Practice Center at Gahanna. The philosophic difference is that the DO tends to treat the entire individual, rather than using\na disease-specific approach to treatment."1	what is meant by corriolis principle?  Christina is wrong. When you drop something, it is already rotating along with the earth, and continues to do so as it falls, for there is nothing to stop it.\n\nIn fact, the real Coriolis effect DEPENDS on the fact that an object dropped, or thrown, or shot out of a gun, is rotating along with the earth. Consider this. A spot on the equator is rotating eastward at about 1,000 miles per hour. Places north of that are rotating eastward slower than that. Places near the north pole are rotating eastward very slowly. A circle around the north pole having a circumfrence of 24 miles is rotating eastward at 1 mile per hour.\n\nIf you position a gun on the equator, the bullet contained therein is travelling eastward at 1,000 miles per hour, along with the gun. If you shoot the gun northward, the bullet wlil travel over land that is travelling eastward slower than 1,000 miles per hour. The bullet, however, will continue to travel eastward at 1,000 miles per hour because there is nothing to stop it. The bullet will appear to have an eastward force applied, but there is no such force.0	Can I become a lesbian? Or can only women apply? Is this discrimination, sexism, the old girls club?

My son has a brilliant academic record (has moved from India to Singapore to do his A level on a Government of Singapore scholarship), has over 100 hours of community service, has published articles in the largest circulated English newspaper in India, has been Vice President of the students council, has been actively participating in debates etc. He is looking forward to a course in liberal arts in the U.S. He has already taken the SAT and is hoing to get about 2300. There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria "hispanic women aviation scholarships" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships.

I sometimes find it interesting to learn how other people's relationships started or went on, it's actually reallly fasinating......so please post your story\nhere's mine:\n\nWhen I was 13 years old I had a best friend that happend to be a girl, I had been riding the bike, she was on my handle bars, and we were heading home. soon we accidentally came upon a really steep hill, and started zooming down it, we both jumped off and watched the bike crash into a tree and get wrecked. We were lying on the ground laughing our heads off (for some reason we thought it was funny :) ) finally we looked at eachother, and i dont know what came over me but, i just....kissed her it was one of the most amazing moments for me.\n\nbut anyways whats your's? I don't really remember my very first kiss because it wasn't that special. I do remember every second of my first kiss with my ex-boyfriend. It was incredible. I was best friends with his little sister from the time we were little kids but I had never met her older brothers because they all lived with their parents in Mexico, my friend was sent to CT when she was little when a couple music schools offered her scholarships, anyway I finally got to meet her brothers five years ago. Damien was nice, so was James. But Aaron was absolutely breath taking. Jocelyn, my friend, told me he had a crush on me but I didn't really believe her. Aaron was throwing a house warming party one night, the guy I had just broken up with showed up at the party and we got into a big fight so I ended up getting really drunk. I was told I passed out in the hallway. I remember waking up in Aaron's arms. He told me some guy was trying to grope me so Aaron picked me up and brought me to one of the bedrooms to sleep it off. I woke up when my head hit the pillow. Aaron sat with me and listened to me ramble on about my ex. I took a long hot shower and when I came out Aaron was still there, he had brought me up some water and migraine pills. I spent the night and in the morning, he made us breakfast. We sat at the kitchen counter eating together, talking, and then during a pause in conversation we looked at eachother and he moved real slowly towards me. We had a long passionate and tender kiss. It was amazing, it made my legs weak. We dated for several years and remain good friends.7	what chapther in the naruto mang began the 2.5 years later? i need to know Chapter 245 is when it starts from the 2.5 year skip5	If the NCAA were to ever have a Division 1 playoff, what kind of format should it have?

PMS symptoms may be relieved by avoiding caffeine, sugar, salt, white flour, red meat, dairy, butter, monosodium glutamate (MSG), fried foods, and processed foods during the two weeks prior to menstruation. Food that help to fight PMS include steamed green vegetables, salad, beans, grains, and fruit. To obtain essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) women can eat flaxseeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, salmon, mackerel, and tuna.\nA variety of herbal remedies may alleviate symptoms associated with menstrual problems. These include:\n• black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa): mood swings,tension, establishing ovulation (an important source of\nphytoestrogens). The German Commission E, however, states that women should not take black cohosh for menstrual problems for longer than six months because of the risk of side effects.\n• black haw (Viburnum prunifolium): cramps\n• chamomile (Matricaria recutita): mood swings, tension, and cramps\n• cramp bark (Viburnum opulus): cramps\n• dandelion (Taraxacum dang gui): fluid retention and bloating\n• dong quai (Benincasa cerifera): PMS symptoms, cramps, irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, or bleeding in between cycles\n• fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): irregular bowel movements1	in calculation of mechanical advantage using pulleys, does the size of the pulley matter?

When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than the information about it can be propagated into the surrounding fluid, fluid near the disturbance cannot react or "get out of the way" before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\n\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud "crack" or "snap" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar "thud" or "thump" of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.\n\nEveryone's familiar with the sonic boom from passing jets - that's a shock wave - but so is a balloon popping!

Which two should I play this weekend on my fantasy team? These are currently the only 3 RBs on my team. They're all pretty good. Shaun just came back from being injured, but the Seahawks are just playing Green Bay so they have pretty good chances. Travis Henry always gets a lot of yards too but they're playing the NY Giants so they'll have a tougher match. Addai always gets me over 10 points but he's not as likely to score big for me. Which 2 should I choose? Henry would be my #1 as I feel that NYG's D is still too badly beat up to be worth anything.  Keep Henry in the lineup, they are still banged up and he's on a hot streak again.\n\nAddai would be my 2nd choice, not because Alexander isn't great but I think his foot is bothering him.  He couldn't make any cuts against the Niners last week, which is concerning.  Also Addai is the goal line back right now and his receptions also help.8	how to make a boy to fell in love with me? im nearly the most popular girl in the 4th 5th and 6th grade and i get anything what i want and nearly the most beautiful of them and one boy i like doesn't even know that i like him Just be yourself.Make him notice you(well you seem to have no prob wt that since your miss popularity).Try and get to know him and make sure he knows the real you.Ask him out make the first move if he still hasn't made the move.And make sure he does like you before you ask him out.\n\nGood luck0	Should they call bisexuals, equal opportunists?

Before i weighed 108 and now i weigh 105. I am 16 years old (August 25, 1989) and 5'3.\n\ni havn't been eating anything i dont normally eat. I know the normal body fat for my age is 15-24, but going down almost 2% scares me... your cold would have nothing to do with losing that much body fat, my question to you is...if you are 16 WHY in the world are you measuring body fat? you are still growing, dont worry about your percentage. Worry about taking care of yourself to get over your cold, and just stay healthy. My suggestion to you would be even though you are sick, try to eat as much protein as possible, even if its just chicken broth, your body needs protein to create more cells and keep your muscle rather than burn it during a temporary reprieve from eating.3	words with es in ez sounding?  Are you talking about words that sound like they have a "z" sound where it is spelled with the letter "s"?\n\n"s" becomes "voiced" when it appears between voiced sounds. "s" and "z" are exactly identical, except for one thing: "s" is unvoiced and "z" is voiced. The same is true for "p" & "b," "k" & "g," "t" & "d," "f" & "v," "ch" & "j," "sh" and the s-sound in "measure," and the two "th" sounds.\n\nWhat's a voiced sound? Put your hand on your throat when you speak. Your vocal cords vibrate when you make a voiced sound. In English, the voiced sounds are a,b,d,e,g,i,j,l,m,n,o,r,u,v, w,y,z, th as in "then," and x as in xylophone. The unvoiced sounds are c,f,h,k,p,q,s,t, th as in "thin," ch, sh, and x as in box.\n\nAlso, the voiced counterpart of "sh" is often spelled with an "s," as in "measure," "usual," and "casual." It's sometimes spelled with a "z" like "azure" or "g" like "garage."\n\nAnyway, not all sounds sound the same all the time. For example, let's look at how "n" changes. Say "nose," and pay attention to where your tongue is. Now say "anger" and pay attention to where your tongue is. It's different, isn't it?? For "nose," the tip of your tongue touches the ridge behind your upper teeth. For "anger," the tip of your tongue NEVER touches ANYTHING, but the back of your tongue rises to the back of your throat. That's because the "n" in "nose" and the "n" in anger are two completely different sounds! "n" turns into that second sound when it appears before a "g" sound. This is called an "allophone-" a change a sound makes when it appears next to certain other sounds.\n\nLet's look at some allophones of "t." Say "top." The tip of your tongue touches the ridge behind your teeth. Now say "button." Your tongue winds up on the ridge when you say the "n"- but notice it's not there for the "t!" The sound of the "t" in "button" is made inside your throat- inside your glottis, to be precise. Now say "beauty"- doesn't it sound more like "beaudy?" That's because "t," like "s," becomes voiced when it appears between voiced sounds.\n\nSo, when dealing with s, it sounds like "s" in words like "soda," "sleep," and "bits," but when you put it between voiced sounds, it becomes "z," such as "easy," "business," and "president."\n\n(also notice- Say "look out for the bees" sounds like and "s," But "Bees are in my hair!" sounds like a "z." Technically, phoneticians (people who know about this stuff) say that "s" becomes voiced after all voiced sounds, but then the "z" becomes de-voiced if it's not followed by a voiced sound, so things cancel out and it just sounds like "s" again. That's why I told you that the voicing only happens BETWEEN voiced sounds.)\n\nOne final note- American English has changed some of these voiced-s words to a more accurate spelling with "z," while British English retains the original spelling. For example, "organization" is the American spelling, and "organisation" is the original British spelling. Now we see here a very interesting occurence- "organisation" was originally spelled with an "s" despite the "z" sound because its ROOT WORD is "organise"- a word that very distinctly ends with a voiceless "s" ("z&quot2	Have you ever had sex in public?

Try these informative sites.\n\nhttp://www.sa-venues.com/wildlife/wildlife_suricate.htm\nhttp://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0209/feature3/\n\nSuricate, also called slender-tailed meerkat, small member of the mongoose family that inhabits the southern part of Africa. Suricates are known for their upright posture and highly sociable behavior.\n\nSuricates typically live in dry, open areas and savannas. Their range extends from southwestern Angola to South Africa. These social animals live in colonies, usually in places with sandy soil where they can dig elaborate underground burrows.\n\nSuricates measure about 25 to 35 cm (10 to 14 in) in length, not including the tail. They are more slender than many mongooses. They have pointed snouts, silvery-brown fur, and irregular dark stripes on the rump. Their faces are white with dark markings on the ears and around the eyes. Unlike most mongooses, suricates have four rather than five toes on each paw.\n\nSuricates forage for food only during the daytime, eating mainly insects, particularly beetles, spiders, and millipedes. They sometimes feed on small vertebrates, eggs, and roots. Suricates typically have two to four young, which are often born in the fall or early winter after a gestational period of about 11 weeks. Both females and males care for, groom, and guard their offspring.\n\nSuricates typically stand up straight on their hind legs or even their toes to sniff the wind and search for attacking vultures. They have excellent vision and are capable of making at least ten types of sounds, including an alarm bark.\n\nBecause suricates can carry rabies, they have been hunted or gassed in their burrows in areas where they pose a threat to humans. This has not reduced their numbers significantly. In South Africa, these affectionate and easily tamed creatures are often kept as pets.\n\nScientific classification: The suricate is a member of the mongoose family, Herpestidae, in the order Carnivora. It is classified as Suricata suricatta.8	what is the best way to resist giggling during oral sex? my bf wants to eat me out and i am very ticklish and hes fingered me and thats about it and im nervous about letting him Express your concerns and tell him if he is tickling you too much.  He may need to adjust the touch a little so it is very satisfying and not to ticklish to you.\n\nHaving said that, you might also want to explore another wonderful form of extended foreplay which I call "ticklish orgasm denial".  Have him restrain you to the bed so you cannot block.  While he is treating you to oral and you feel the orgasms developing, he will suddenly tickle you on your feet or stomach or sides or armpits for 15 - 30 seconds and then he will immediately return to the oral stimulation.  After 30 - 60 minutes of ticklish orgasm denial, he will treat you to one of the most satisfying orgasms you will ever have.  \n\nThis will only work if there is a strong trust and respect there so he will not abuse you or take advantage of you.  He really needs to want to please you for this to work.1	can a kidney infection effect a woman's menstral cycle? recently had a kidney infectionim now over it as far as i know but im now two days late on my period. im really worried about pregnancy although i always make sure my partner checks the condom to see if its broken. ofourse i understand that this worry could be causing stress and then may have effected my cycle also. am i late because of my kidney infection?? please help!

The lightweight and soft medium between your head and the object colliding with it dims the force. \nFor example, yelling through an empty hall will allow the sound to travel easily, but if you stuck in another wall reaching from roof to floor with no gaps then the sound would be dimmed out and would have a smaller impact.

I take online surveys.  For each one I take, I get entered into a sweepstakes. I'm not sure what my odds are, let's just say 1:1000.  My question is: do my odds of winning go up with each survey I take, or are my odds always the same, starting over each time? A good analogy here is flipping a fair coin.  So like if you have flipped a coin 5 times and each time came up heads.  What is the probability that the 6th time will be heads as well?  \n\nAnswer: the same as it was the 1st, 2nd, 3rd... 50/50.  Each event is independent of every other event, so the probability is always the same for each individual event.  \n\nNow, if you flip 6 coins simultaneously, and you want to know what the probability of getting at least one head then you use the Binomial Distribution formula:\n\n  b(k;n,p) = (n choose k)(p^k)(1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere n = the total number of possible outcomes\nand k = the amount of desired outcomes\nand p = the probability of k occurring\nand 1 - p = the probability of k not occurring\n\nNote: "n choose k" is found using the general formula (n!/[(n-k)!k!]\nwhich is like...well say n =5 then n! is 5x4x3x2x1 (in the numerator) and say k = 3 then the denominator is (2x1)(3x2x1).  \n\nIs that clear as mud?4	does windows xp home edition have a way to zip files built in it? or do i have to get winzip? i want to zip a file... what everyone else said. they are right. but can i get the points?1	Why doe sthe sporophyte in moss might be present only on certain gametophyte plants?

I am making her wedding Album for her gift. Here is the thing, should I drive ( 4 1/2 hours) to her house when she gets the pictures or would it be rude to ask her to send up the pictures???\n Any ideas???\nAnd great ideas on fun ways to make the alubm ( scrapbook) Some things to think about:\n1)After the wedding is over, maybe you can coordinate a weekend or an overnight trip where you can take the drive, visit, get the pictures and share with her some of your ideas for a wedding album.  If you want the wedding album to be a total surprise, forfeit the first idea.\n2)If you do decide to take the first idea and you consider that today is January 20th, you realize that you still have alot of time to organize page layout, colors, find some stickers, stamps, markers, ribbons,  etc.  I realize that you will not know everything there is to know about the wedding yet since it hasn't happened, but every wedding clearly has a similar layout.\n\nSome ideas for the wedding album.  Try to get some random things from alot of people who were involved with or attended the wedding.  For example, you might get some pictures from alot of different people and decide which ones would be good for a nice storybook album.  You might want to do a brief page at the beginning of the album that gives a little bit of the couple's background...a picture of their houses as they were growing up, pictures with parents and siblings, senior year pictures, baby/toddler pictures, etc., a lock of hair if it is available.  Dedicate another section for dating-pictures at various events, silly pictures, engagement picture, etc.  Put some pre wedding pictures in there...the girls getting ready with applying makeup, getting hair done, pictures of bride and groom all dressed up with families, etc.  Put a copy of the wedding program in the album.  See if you can get some of the flower petals to put in various sections of the album.  Maybe put another page with "Couples Favorites" and include favorite song(s), hangout spots, dating activities, etc.  Last year, I went to a Creative Memories workshop and the consultant was really knowledgable regarding assisting with layout ideas, content ideas, etc.  I have also included the website link for Creative Memories http://www.creativememories.com/ so that you can take a look.  On the website, you will be able to find consultants in your area based on your zip code and there are ideas on how to set up albums.  I'm not suggesting that you order everything that Creative Memories has on their website, but there are alot of really helpful ideas to get you started as well as helpful ideas for making the album durable and long lasting.  Hope you have fun with the wedding and with scrapbooking!! :o)2	where can I get affordable health insurance in Arkansas??  try the blue cross website or the healthnet website, see what they offer.\n\nI don't think you can find afforable health insurance anywhere.

I am just curious if anyone has chiari malformation and if you had the surgery, where and with what doctor? I don't have it, but I do know two people with it in real life and people with it online.  I have ideopathic intracranial hypertension.  Um... are you talking about the decompression surgery?  The person I know who had the decompression surgery had type 1 as a child and I have not seen him in a long time, the person who developed symptoms as an adult still has not had the surgery- she is waiting until it gets to where she doesn't have the option not to have the surgery.  Both went to University of Chicago Hospitals I believe.  Please e-mail me if you want.  You should be able to find some support site online.\n\n-Nicole\n\n*edit below*\n\nThe surgery is HIGHLY invasive.  Google "chiari decompression".  It is also like rolling a dice... no certainty that it will or will not work.  Do you research, there are neurosurgeons that specialise in it.  Some people with Chiari type 1 live there entire lives and never know it... so the idea that it is a fatal condition is by no means accurate.  For some people it is fatal... see this website- support groups help, people with Chiari would be more knowledgeable than Yahoo Answers. http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/chiari/ .

You know as little as 80 years ago there we very few cars, no one had hydro or gas bills to pay, we burned wood to keep warm, or stuffed hay into the attic or walls. Maybe the Amish and Mennonites are right? Do we really "need" these things? I'd say we go back to the pioneer days, only for the fact that most of us would die trying, which may be one way to lower the population problem as well? Hmm, kill two birds with one stone as it were. Its all a scam, the U.S. owns Kuwait and Iraq, takes almost 90% of Canadas oil and natural gas, then there's Alaska and it looks like Iran is going to be next. Why was gas like only $1.20 a gallon before all this then is what I would like to know.8	is he cheating on me?? he has this friend from about 9 years ago and she leaves him this comments on myspace all the time like "hehehe ur soo sily and hyper Danny guess what ?? weeee" gay shit like that what should i think about that?? If it's JUST MySpace comments that's innocent enough, but because you are posting here, I am guessing there are other things going on......drop in sex life, less interested in home.. spending more and more time away from home.. secret calls.. check cell records and if detailed billing is off, TURN IT ON one month if you aren't sure and check the bill.  TRUST YOUR GUT.. We women tend to 'blow it off' wayyyyyyyy too much and there is a reason that God gave us that intuition, and it wasn't to ignore it.  PAY close attention to him, and don't confront.. get the 'facts' as best you can first.... THEN confront.  A comment on MySpace isn't sufficient proof of anything other than he's known a chick for 9 yrs and she has his MySpace addy! \n\nNow why does he have a MySpace addy?  Married people shouldn't have that unless they have 'kids' and grandparents/aunts/uncles etc.. are living out of state and it's to 'share pictures'.. that's really the only excuse that I can think of for an account on that site.  \n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you, and please remember, 50% of marriages have had 1 partner cheat during the marriage, and it is NOT wise to assume you are 'in the other 50% that haven't cheated' if your 'radar' is going off at this time.\n\nBest wishes to how all this works out... I really believe that 'accusing someone of cheating' needs to be backed up with proof or it's destructive to a marriage where there is no cheating happening.. and it's a 'trust' that you can't easily repair if no harm has really happened.  Have your facts, keep  your cool......and when/if the time comes, THEN confront (he'll lie most likely so sometimes I see no point in having the confrontation because we women WANT them to 'fess up and they hardly ever do.. so why put yourself through the stress).  BEFORE you investigate any further, decide WHAT  you will do, if he is cheating.. and then FOLLOw through if it's true that he is.  Sometimes I think the 'biggest' slap in the face/shock to them, is that you kicked him out/walked out, and said I'm not putting up with your BS lies anymore ........ and walk away without ANY FURTHER explanation.. afterall - he never gave you one right?  Why does he deserve any better?  Go see a good divorce attorney and make sure you get good alimony and find out if 'cheating' is grounds in your state for divorce.  If so, get enough evidence then take him to the cleaners!\n\nBefore the guys go ballistic on my post, The truth is, if it was the woman cheating, I'd give the same advice.. If you aren't married but have a 'joint checking account/savings account.. clean it up before you ever say a worrd and walk out after, and let him find out he has no money :D8	How can I stop my addiction to Porn? I have no idea what to do?  It's getting to difficult. First of all, I am really glad that you see it as a problem. I am proud of you. I was also curious why you are wanting to practice abstinence until you get married. I know that I also am living that way, because the Bible commands it from me, but I just wanted to know your reasoning behind it. \n\nI do know that you can't do it alone. You will need help. I think I know who can help you stay away from this temptation. Jesus can take away even the desire to look at these things. He can help you get through this. I'm not sure how else to explain it, but, if you would like, you can talk to me and I will explain it further. (My email address is on my profile page thingy)6	Who are you?

A big part of confidence is in the way you carry yourself.  Stand up straight.  Think of a straight line going up your legs and spine straight to the top of your head and align your stance to it.  Smile when you see people, and look them in the eye (briefly, don't stare).  Think of yourself as the confident person you want to be, and imagine the positive reactions of those around you.  Make a practice of this regularly.  You may not only find this enjoyable, but there is scientific evidence it actually works to boost confidence in people who practice it regularly.  Good luck!8	who celebrated Halloween? i couldnt celebrate it this year because i was working, i did a kids halloween party where i work....did any of you actually go out dressed up....and did you go trick or treating, stories please Hi I took my 3 daughters out around the local estate-But before we went out we had a t-party-It was nice cos they didn't know I was doing it for them-\nIt's the first halloween since I separated from my ex-He was violent-And he missed out big style cos we all had loads of fun.\nEven the baby was dressed up !!!!!!!!!2	can i loose 50k.g within 3  months without exercising but eating healthy food coz i dont have time for gym?

I didn't want a D&C so my Doctor inserted 4 tablets inside me to induce miscarriage/abortion. Went back to the doctor for follow-up 2 days later and did an ultrasound. I was told that all tissues had pass, uterus was clean and uterine lining was thin. I still see some tissue passing when I got home along with blood clots. The blood that's flowing out is very thick and stretchy, also flowing out really slow. Is that normal? Anyway, it's been 10 days already and I'm still bleeding. Not a lot or heavy, it's just a little here and there throughout the day for about 3 days now. How can I tell that all tissue had pass with that kind of bleeding? Miscarriage bleeding wasn't as heavy like what the doctor told me. It's just like a normal period to me. Although the bleeding looks like it's going to stop any day now, I'm still worry that it might be an incomplete miscarriage. Please help!  Thanks! If you continue to have bleeding, then there may be some tissue that didn't get expelled from the uterus.  As long as the bleeding is scant, you can probably just wait and see if the bleeding stops on it's own.  If the bleeding continues, the only thing to do at that point would be a D&C.3	where can i find a website that has definitions as well as example sentences?  http://dictionary.reference.com/\n\nhttp://elc.polyu.edu.hk/cill/dictiona.htm\n\nhttp://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nI hope that helps : )3	Someone Explain What Is Ethics And Moralities To Me Plz!!? distinguish the different between moral and ethics\nthx you very much As far as I ever learned, they are two words meaning the same thing, synonyms.  \n\nMorality refers to the concept of human ethics which pertains to matters of good and evil —also referred to as "right or wrong", used within three contexts: individual conscience; systems of principles and judgments — sometimes called moral values —shared within a cultural, religious, secular, Humanist, or philosophical community; and codes of behavior or conduct.\n\nThe field of ethics, also called moral philosophy, involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Philosophers today usually divide ethical theories into three general subject areas: meta ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.5	SKIING in BULGARIA over NYE. Good snow there? Whats the best resort? Also, whats the party scene on the slopes and in nearby towns for NYE? Yeah, the mountains in Bulgaria always have a lot of snow during the winter and there are really some good ski resorts. The best are Borovets, Bansko, Pamporovo and the slopes on Vitosha (that's the mountain near the capital city of Bulgaria - Sofia). The resorts in Bulgaria are not expensive, you can afford pretty much everything. They are a fantastic choice for NYE, because they organise lovely dinners. The nature in Bulgaria is pretty amazing, the people are also really friendly. \n\nHope I've been helpful and hope you have some great time at NYE ;)9	Liberal Media vs. Republican Media - any middle ground? It seems that the Republicans are saying that the media is all owned and operated by liberals but FOX and all it's affiliated stations are quite the opposite.\n\nWho do you turn to for real non-partisan news?\nSerious answers only please - nobody likes a flamer. One thing to keep in mind is that the "mainstream media" whether FOX, MSNBC, CNN, and the TV networks ABC, NBC, CBS, etc., are all owned by about 6 mega-corporations...\n\nand all these corporations are "for profit" - which means that their main goal is to keep you watching - watching and hopefully buying what they are selling via commercials. Trust me, their main goal is NOT to inform you about what you need to know WHEN you need to know it...\n\nSo my point here is that there is no real "liberal" or "conservative" media per se.  Yes, the reporters may tend to be more liberal, but the EDITING decisions are made by the "suits", and there are way more conservatives in control at this level.  \n\nWhat you may not realize are the ties the media has to government - and how they work hand in hand to censor the important news you really need to know.\n\nSo the short answer is:  Check out the internet but pay close attention to the source - after a while you will be able to tell when you have reached a credible source or not.  European media has some of the same problems (propagana via corporate control) but they are way ahead of the U.S. when it comes to telling more of the truth - especially about us!  \n\nAn admittedly liberal site http://www.buzzflash.com will give you links to stories all over the world.  But, while they *are* liberal, they are actually linking to the original story in whatever media it was originally reported - so you can read the original story and decide for yourself.  http://www.truthout.org is another similar type site without all the added commentary (editoralizing)...\n\nDo some searches on the web for WHO OWNS THE MEDIA and you'll see for yourself why the media censors your news.\n\nThink about this:  GE makes bombs for the military.  GE also owns NBC.  Now, if you PROFIT from making bombs, what is your motivation to tell the American public the WHOLE truth in advance of a "war"?  Better to let some of the truth out about fake wars AFTER they have begun.  They aren't going to admit to being war profiteers, but the fact of the matter is that they DO profit from war.  Do the math.9	Poltical leaders...? Why is it that everytime we vote for someone for office we praise that person during the elections, as soon as they get to office people start to look down on the efforts of the person we voted for. It is a continous circle- like bill clition, just cause he had an affiar with a lady we hated his guts even though we loved the guy when he was running for presedent. No matter who is it we still wont agree with the person - it is like america has a trust issue or something. Not everybody praises people while they are running but there is so much hype with campaign promises and coventions that people just go a little crazy. \n\nBut yes there are always going to be critics and it is just human nature. No matter what a president/government does to help one group it will hurt another. So yeah America doesn't really have a trust issue but it does have a lot of pissed off people...they are angry..8	What do i do for him to ask me out?

We do have health insurance benefits with varying coverages depending on the company plans.   If we have prescription coverage we don't have to pay for the prescriptions at all. Insurance costs a small ransome and if you have it most cna't afford to pay there co-pay. Most are underinsured! And sick people often can't see a doctor! Or get the medicine they need! That is the good o USA!!! Why Bush has life on easy street ~~ Most have no job, home , car and hope! But you know if they would find JESUS CHRIST~~ They would live!4	How do I make a website?

That was in the World Championships back when he was a youngster.5	custume golf clubs?  Custom golf clubs are a must for golfers who are trying to improve their game.

Don't run to him and tell him that you like him... maybe express your desire for a boyfriend, or a lover... tell him you've got a date with someone promising, and watch his reaction. \nTry to look your best (I don't mean modify your appearance, just make the best of it), and let out provocative comments now and then (not directed at him, just in general).\nHis reactions through this will let you know whether he has an interest in you.\nRemember: things change. Maybe he has not thought of you as a potential bride. What you need to do is getting him started at it. Once the thought appears once in his mind, it will come back. It depends on you to make it more and more frequent. \nDon't risk your friendship though... Be subtle enough to make it noticeable; but not as obvious as to make him uncomfortable if he doesn't like you.4	what is the actual reason why do CPUs wont start.  Good monitor and its cable... cpu dont display CMOS startup Upon switching on the CPU... the monitor displays monitor is enabled and with signal.... but after that no actions on CPUs... Power supply is on.... hardisk lights on... but no CMOS reaction... rather no displays of CPUs at all... First of all, it's not a display of your CPU. It's you powering up your system.\n\nIt could be a number of scenarios:\n1. Something is wrong with your RAM (A good indication of this is if your computer beeps as soon as it starts up and a blank screen remains).\n2. Your motherboard could be fried (Odds of that are low since you claim to have monitor signal, revealing that your video card is fine).\n3. Your CPU is fried. Only real way to check this is to find another motherboard compatible with your CPU and test it.\n4. Your CMOS battery is dead. Replace it.\n\nFrom my past experience, #3 and #4 are your most likely scenarios in this case. Hopefully it's only #4 that's the problem.\n\nGood luck.5	Who do you WANT to win the NBA Finals?

You should specify which state or province you are from, because it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nHere in Ontario, it also depends on which county or regional municipality you live in.  In some cities, you go to the unified family court.  In other cities or towns, you either go to the Ontario Court of Justice, or the Superior Court of Justice, depending on what the issues are.  If it is a divorce, or if there are property issues, you must go to the Superior Court.  If it is simply custody and access, child support, or a child protection matter, you go to the Ontario Court.0	what's the meanest, harshest, most cruelest thing you've ever done to someone?

I'm not proud of those, so I'll stick with the answer above.1	what's capacitor?  Capacitor, device for storing an electrical charge, sometimes called a condenser. In its simplest form a capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a non-conducting layer called the dielectric. The dielectric may be air, plastic, waxed paper, or another substance such as the mineral mica. When one plate of a capacitor is charged using a battery or other source of direct current, the other plate becomes charged with the opposite sign; that is, positive if the original charge is negative, and negative if the original charge is positive\nThe electrical size of a capacitor is its capacitance, that is the amount of electric charge it can hold per unit potential difference across its plates—C = Q/V. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F). Because this is such a large unit, capacitors commonly have their size expressed in µF (1 microfarad = 10-6 F) or pF (1 picofarad = 10-9 F).1	European Exploration...PLsssss? Can you tell me the cause and effects in the EUROPEAN EXPLORATION? Why did the European explored to the New World(like the west indies) Think about things in the big picture.\n\nAt first, trade and investigation were done on foot (which could include by horse, camel, etc and/or cart). This meant that exploration and trade only occurred with those areas that you could walk to ... which also meant that by the time the Europeans were a working civilization that the continents of North and South America were inaccessible.\n\nHowever, Asia and Africa were not! And thus trade and exploration started from Europe and proceeded EASTWARD, until eventually a connection was made with China and the Far East.\n\nAt about the same time as the trade routes got really established, advances in seafaring were beginning to make a difference in how things were done. Notably, one could now sail somewhere in a few weeks that once took many months of travel on foot. Case in point - again, the transit time to the Far East.\n\nBy now, Europeans had also come to the conclusion that the world was a ball, not a plate. This meant (in theory) that someone could go the other way (WESTWARD), and possibly develop a shorter trip to reach the trade markets of the Orient. Several nations jumped into the act; notable among them were the French, English, Dutch, and Spanish.\n\nEveryone took a slightly different tack, for a couple of reasons. Either they already knew that a route wasn't going to happen (the French didn't have the fleet capacity or the seamanship for extended out-of-land voyages yet), or they wanted to stay away and not let the rest in on the secret (Spain had an advantage; being in the south already, they could cut more-or-less across at the same latitude to find the Orient, whereas the Dutch and English kind of had to try a more northerly route).\n\nThe final outcome was the discovery of "america" (in actuality, today's West Indies) by Spain, followed quickly by devlopment of what is now North America by the English and French. The Dutch followed in the Spaniards' footsteps, and found a promising region somewhat south of the Indies (Tortuga, Trinidad/Tobago, etc).\n\nEveryone got into the act of grabbing what they could from the New World ... and eventually someone figured out they hadn't reached the Orient after all. Then came the race for the Northwest Passage, and the southern journeys of Magellan and so on ...0	Why are so many people pregnant and having babies on these boards? Is it the trend of society?

Should some Christians stop being negative and judgmental when spreading the good word? Should some non-Chrisitians stop judging all Christians based on the bad actions of a few? What is to be done? \n\nP.S. - I am not trying to endorse the Christian religion, preach to anyone, etc. Just ask this as a generic question. The Christian image could be improved by Christian families by displaying "family values" in public such as praying at the table before eating their food in restaurants.  You can tell a Christian by their acts of kindness, their acts of non rudeness.  They do not boast about their religion, but set a good example of being Christ like....not like Christ around other people.  They are just "darn nice people"!   When you are looking at a person who is really making you mad, picture them as though it were Christ's face and then see how you would answer them instead of what you were gonna do or say.  It's dramatically different than what you were thinking at first.  Jesus loves OUR ememies as much as He loves us.  That's all I can say about it right now.9	Isn't the local records free and oren to the general public and shouldn't have to pay to see but pay for copie I was looking for records about a person in my friends life that he had doubts about. He was told so many different things by this person and the end results in going to court never seemed to fit the crime. More or less, this is true. It can be a time consuming and stressful process dealing with bureaucrats though. For instance, if you are arrested in your city and then later the police decide not to file a report or charges and everything is dropped, THIS DOES NOT MEAN a record has been erased. It might have been erased at the city and state level but EVERY arrest made, regardless or whether it is dropped or not, is sent directly to the FBI. Since the boom of the Internet search engine and skip tracing technology for the every day person, many private businesses can now get their hands on this information (sometimes done illegally)...but one private business that can access any FBI record is any business which issues credit or abides by the FDIC ( and doesn't that include almost all businesses now)? The freedom of information act, which you might have been referring to,does exist (sorry if I got off the subject). But do a search on the Internet and order one of yourself and see how confusing and complicated it is though.6	How do you get a 4 yr old to eat anything except sweets?

I do. I'm not religious, and the thing I belive in is each individual. You are your only owner and therefor you sexand your sex desires belong only to yourself, so if you want to practice sex and are old enough, mature enough and you've taken all the precautions you can have sex whenever you want to. Some people think sex belongs to marriage, some others believe that one should only have sex with someone they love (that's my case) and some others think it is ok to have sex with whoever you want to if both of the partners agree on it. From my opinion, all the choices are as respectable. Nobody is morally superior for waiting to have sex until marriage, that is just a personal decission that has to be respected.4	Is it possible for me to burn my videos that I have on the computer onto DVD's?

Post-vacation syndrome (PVS) is a real syndrome that involves emotional and psychological effects. While going off on vacation is fun and relaxing, dealing with the feelings of letdown after your vacation is stressful and depressing for most people. The following tips will help you overcome that letdown feeling before you go away.\n\n1. Prepare to return to a clean house.\n\n\nComing back to a clean and orderly house will keep your good feelings up. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do the work yourself, however. You can hire a maid to clean and organize your home 1-2 days before you leave or return.\n\n2. Set aside 15 minutes a day to read your e-mail.\n\n\nContrary to popular opinion, not responding to your e-mail is stressful during a vacation. Most of us dread the deluge of e-mails that we must face when we get back, particularly if you run a business or enterprise. The dread of having all that e-mail to respond to when you get back is overwhelming; taking a few minutes a day to do this will lessen the pressure and stress of having to do it all when you return. The key here is to take NO MORE than 15 minutes a day.\n\n3. Plan fun time into your first week back.\n\n\nWhether it's going to the movies, reading a book, or taking a hike, having an activity that you can look forward to will help ease the transition back into your everyday routine.\n\n4. Develop your photographs as soon as you get home.\n\n\nDeveloping your photos immediately will keep you in the spirit of the pleasurable vacation time longer.\n\n5. Plan your next vacation on your return trip home.\n\n\nAgain, this gives you something to look forward to and prolongs the relaxing effects of the wonderful time you just had.\n\n6. Plan to work only 1-2 extra hours/day upon your return.\n\n\nMost of us quickly undo the beneficial effects and feelings of our vacations by immersing ourselves in 12-15 hour days when we get back in order to catch up. Planning just an extra 1-2 hours keeps you on top of the workload without rapidly becoming exhausted.\n\n7. Adjust your client schedule.\n\n\nIf you're in a service industry (such as coaching), adjust your client schedule for that month so that you don't have to play catch-up for sessions missed. For example, if you usually coach clients 4 times/month, plan to coach only 3 times that month. Of course, this will entail adjustments on your fees as well but it is well worth the degree of stress you can eliminate from your routine.\n\n8. Play music reminders.\n\n\nPlaying the music of the place where you've been is a soothing reminder of your pleasant vacation and keeps the memories alive longer.\n\n9. Talk about your vacation.\n\n\nTalking to others about your vacation keeps it in the forefront of your mind longer.\n\n10. Stay in touch with people you've met.\n\n\nAs busy as that first week back to work and routine is, it's a good time to make that phone call to 1-2 people you've promised to stay in touch with. Staying in touch keeps the vacation going over time, and it gives you an opportunity to develop new friendships too.0	are all these people that give answers jackass?

Jesus the carpenter is probably still building our houses there :-)2	What's the best way to get rid of a wart on my finger?  Warts Treatment\nSelf-Care at Home\nHome care is effective in making the wart or warts go away. No matter what technique you use, warts will disappear 60-70% of the time. Techniques may be done with or without medication. \n\nThe ultimate goal of the medical therapies (not the surgical treatments) is to get your body to recognize the wart as something foreign and to destroy it, much like the body destroys a cold virus.\n\nAdhesive tape therapy \n\nPlace several layers of waterproof adhesive tape over the wart region (even duct tape). Do not remove the tape for 6 1/2 days. Then take off the tape and open the area to the air for 12 hours. Reapply tape for another 6 1/2 days. \nThe tape works best in the region around the fingernail. This area may scar if cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is used. Scarring could lead to permanent nail disfiguration. \nTape works because the airtight, moist environment under the tape does not allow the virus to grow and reproduce. \nSalicylic acid therapy \n\nSalicylic acid is available by many different trade names at the drug store. It comes either as a liquid to paint on the wart or as a plaster to be cut out and placed on the wart tissue. \nThe area with the wart should be soaked in warm water for 5-10 minutes. The wart should then be pared down with a razor. A simple plastic razor works fine for this, then throw it away. Do not shave far enough to make the wart bleed. \nApply the salicylic acid preparation to the wart tissue. Do not apply it to other skin because of salicylic acid's potential to injure normal tissue. \nFollow directions on the package for how long to apply the acid. \nIf you have genital warts , see a doctor. The treatments described here are not appropriate for genital warts and should not be used.\n\nMedical Treatment\nIn addition to recommending the home care treatments, such as taping and salicylic acid, the doctor may typically choose to treat the wart more aggressively. \n\nLiquid nitrogen: Liquid nitrogen or cryotherapy is used to deep freeze the wart tissue. With liquid nitrogen applied to the wart, the water in the cells expands, thus exploding the infected tissue. The exploded cells can no longer hide the human papillomavirus from the body's immune system. The immune system then works to destroy the virus particles.\nLaser therapy: Lasers are simply very intense light sources. This light has an enormous amount of energy that heats the tissue enough that it vaporizes.\nSurgical removal: Surgery may be necessary when other treatment methods fail. This would involve numbing the region around the wart and cutting out the wart.\n\nI'm not sure about the spreading part, but i'm going to say yes. A wart develops when a human papillomavirus infects the outermost layer of skin and causes the skin cells to grow rapidly. The virus can then spread from an existing wart to other areas of the body, causing more warts. Various types of this virus thrive in warm, moist environments such as showers, locker room  \n\nI take care of my own.  I used the dr schol's one and then pulled the rest of it off and then pulled out the core.. the core looks like a long black core.9	how many people does it take to make a town become a city?  What is the difference between a city and a town?\n\nIn the United States, an incorporated city is a legally defined government entity, with powers delegated by the state and county and created and approved by the voters of the city. It can provide local government services to its citizens.\n\nIn most places in the U.S. a town, village, community, or neighborhood is simply an unincorporated community with no governmental powers.

No Suggestion All things being equal, the higher the frequency,the more energetic the effect- So, a laser with a frequency in the yellow range, for example, would have less effect than one in the blue range, which has a higher frequency.  The ultimate would likely be an ultraviolet laser, which is very high energy and slightly penetrating as well.  Theoretically, and X-ray laser would be the most devastating, because of the penetration, but as far as I know, that is still a long ways off.5	who will be American League MVP this year?

Harry can communicate with him though, using the portrait that appeared after his death.\n\nIt's more likely that Snape is indeed loyal to the order of the Phoenix and that him killing Dumbledore was something that he and Dumbledore set up together (remember their fight in book 6, the one that Harry overheard?) knowing full well that this would ensure that \na) Voldermort would finally take a chance to actually kill Harry, something he wouldn't do as long as Dumbledore was still alive\nand\nb) Voldemort really believes that Snape is a loyal deatheater, thus making sure that Voldemort doesn't expect Snape to kil him. Which will of course happen, probably helped by Harry. And probably Snape is going to die in this attempt.4	How to change Security answer for Yahoo email service?

There are two ways to make money from home in both industries. In medical transcription you have the choice of:\n\n1) Contracting with one of the many companies that will send you the work via a secured connection (high speed internet), you do process the work, send it back to them as directed and then you will be paid for the completed work.\n\n2) You can start your own medical transcription business, find your own clients to work with, process their workload and then get paid for the services that you rendered.\n\nIn medical billing there aren’t any legitimate companies that I know of that will hire or contract you to process their medical claims for them so the only option that you have is to start your own home based medical billing business/service.\n\nI do both medical billing and transcription from home and I own the businesses. I have never contracted with other companies to process their work because to me it’s just like working as an employee and we all know that to become financially secure you have to be owner of a thriving business not the hired help.\n\nThere are two resources that you should read because they are by experts within each field: \n\n1) "Step-By-Step Guide To Medical Transcription At Home". Michele Miller wrote this book and her advice can be found on every reputable medical transcription message board and forums. She has been in the business for years and is an expert on the topic of how to get involved in this industry so visit http://stelopm.mml461.hop.clickbank.net \n\n2) “Medical Billing Book For Beginners”.

It hurts a lot because you have let it mean a lot to you. In a way, you gave power to her, and you kind of relinquished emotionally; you kind of put your life in her hands, and your self-worth upon her acceptance of you.\nThere's probably not much you can do about it now that everything happened.\nI say that retrospecting back to a similar, extremely traumatizing experience I had. I was in so much pain, for months. It was because I had invested my pride in her. That's always a mistake. You need to kind of "carry your own pride" and not expect your woman to hold all of it.\nWhat I refer to "investing your pride" is a process by which you try to come to terms with being with her. The first feeling is that you like her a lot, and in essence she becomes some type of possession or trophy, and she determines your social standing. Then a paradox happens: you think "since she's so great, and she's with me, that means I'm great... no wait... I'm even greater than her"!. that's when things start falling apart. Too much of that, and then she leaves, and you're don't feel that great anymore.\nMaybe I'm like way off. This is just my guess.\nThe solution is to concentrate on your goals. read as many self-help books you can on goal setting and "reaching your dreams" and stuff. Audio books are even better, it's like listening to a friend trying to help. Good luck.2	Is working nightshifts bad for your body and is it just a myth?

What's funny anyway? Folks, define funny. Why do people laugh? What would make anyone laugh other than tickling? Most of the times we laugh at "that" funny thing,by thinking,\n"Thank God! That didn't happend with me...."\n\nWHY DO WE LAUGH?\nLaughter is part of the universal human vocabulary. All members of the human species understand it. Unlike English or French or Swahili, we don’t have to learn to speak it. We’re born with the capacity to laugh.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about laughter is that it occurs unconsciously. You don’t decide to do it. While we can consciously inhibit it, we don’t consciously produce laughter. That’s why it’s very hard to laugh on command or to fake laughter. (Don’t take my word for it: Ask a friend to laugh on the spot.)\n\nLaughter provides powerful, uncensored insights into our unconscious. It simply bubbles up from within us in certain situations.\n\nVery little is known about the specific brain mechanisms responsible for laughter. But we do know that laughter is triggered by many sensations and thoughts, and that it activates many parts of the body. \n\nWhen we laugh, we alter our facial expressions and make sounds. During exuberant laughter, the muscles of the arms, legs and trunk are involved. Laughter also requires modification in our pattern of breathing.\n\nWe also know that laughter is a message that we send to other people. We know this because we rarely laugh when we are alone (we laugh to ourselves even less than we talk to ourselves).\n\nLaughter is social and contagious. We laugh at the sound of laughter itself. That’s why the Tickle Me Elmo doll is such a success — it makes us laugh and smile.\n\nThe first laughter appears at about 3.5 to 4 months of age, long before we’re able to speak. Laughter, like crying, is a way for a preverbal infant to interact with the mother and other caregivers.\n\nContrary to folk wisdom, most laughter is not about humor; it is about relationships between people. To find out when and why people laugh, I and several undergraduate research assistants went to local malls and city sidewalks and recorded what happened just before people laughed. Over a 10-year period, we studied over 2,000 cases of naturally occurring laughter.\n\nWe found that most laughter does not follow jokes. People laugh after a variety of statements such as “Hey John, where ya been?” “Here comes Mary,” “How did you do on the test?” and “Do you have a rubber band?”. These certainly aren’t jokes.\n\nWe don’t decide to laugh at these moments. Our brain makes the decision for us. These curious “ha ha ha’s” are bits of social glue that bond relationships.\n\nCuriously, laughter seldom interrupts the sentence structure of speech. It punctuates speech. We only laugh during pauses when we would cough or breathe.4	Photo Printing Problems?

I've just bought a Swatch, and on the back it says Patented water-resistant...... four(4) Jewels, I also went on e-bay to look at watches and found some realy old (50's/60's) watches with 17 and 23 jewels in them, I guessing the jewels aren't diamonds or emeralds etc so what are they? and why are they in the watch? Jewels are used as the bearing surfaces for pivot points and gear axles. They are tiny precious stones.\nBecause they are so hard they do not require lubrication when polished.  \nIn mechanical watches there were always an odd number of jewels due to the single jewel in the escapement. Modern crystal oscillator types have no escapement so the low even number of jewels is because of the reduced number of pivots in the watch compared to old gear driven watches where jewels are used in pairs plus one for the escapement.\nMore jewels usually means a higher quality and more accurate watch.9	Can people with felonies be rehabilitated?  it depends on what they are for2	When is the best time to discuss the dangers of HIV with your future partner?

A few of them will even sleep with a guy, especially a Marine, no questions asked, just because he's a Marine.  I would think it's not too hard to tell when that's the case.  I know some people find it flattering, but I would think it would be insulting too, as if if you didn't wear a uniform to work, you would just be another guy.  What do you think?\n\nI'm attracted to men in uniform myself, but that doesn't mean I'd slut myself for it, or overlook the fact that a guy is an ass just because he looks good in his uniform. Its a cliche. Its like why people have to wear like Polo or Nautica or have Coach purses. Its a cliche and its a style they "want' and they think they "need" \n\nWomen think that they feel secure with a man in the military, when in reality, we're just another guy. Yeah we work in bigger "corporations" where we have weapons, and special traning blah bah blah, but in reality, hello? we're just men. Men are men no matter what. \n\nAgain, NOt all military guys are a ss holes. And not all of them are jerks. you have to be the judge of that. No way you can just judge them on their uniform. And think, "wow that guy has a lot of medals, he must be really good." Sorry it doesn't work that way. \n\nWomen, no offense I think in my own opinion, they just want to be flattered.

As a child the chandelier used to swing from side to side, and the radio would turn on by itself in the middle of the night.\n\nOne time on a camping trip I was walking back from the bathrooms at that moment right between day and night and I saw someone walk across the front of the site and stop behind a tree. So I figure one of the people is going to jump out and try to surprise me, so I pull out my flashlight, walk up to the tree, turn on the light, and there's no one there.\n\nOne time I was alone in a house, and I felt a presence. I looked at a mobile hanging motionless, and said, "If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin." The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero.

People throw the word "love" around too loosely.  No one can love a person whom they do not know.  That is lust, not love.  If people would drop petty criteria such as height, weight, skin, hair and eye color, dress, flash and bling and look at how the object of their interest is treating them and others around them, they would experience true and lasting love.  When one knows the value and rarity of real love and appreciates it, then love can be returned to the one who deserves it.  One cannot receive or give what he or she cannot recognize and identify.1	How does the Lexus LS parallel park automatically?  How well can it auto-park? No need to get very specific.

This is not a scientific question-- there is no data that you can measure to quantify an answer to this question.  Its a philisophical/metaphysical inquiry.  A valuable inquiry, but still not a scientific inquiry.  \nMy philosphy: There is no meaning to life.-- but that life is meaningless doesn't mean anything.  The good news is that you get to choose what you want your life to mean-- you can make it up!  Figure out what inspires you and calls you to be fully alive.  And follow that.  \nThe meaning of life for me is to live-- and live fully, making a contribution to others-- causing this to be a world that I can be proud to live in.\nNow, I have no way of proving this, but if you find any of it valuable, use it-- if not, keep searching 'til you find the answer that works best for you.\nHave fun!2	When you first start taking a multivitamin? do they make you feel a little under the weather?

I think there are a couple of significant differences\nbetween marriage and civil union.\n\nThe first is emotional.  "Marriage" has a deep meaning\nto many/most people, and to be able to be married means\nmore to them than just the financial/legal aspects of\na civil contract.\n\nThe second is that there really are some legal areas\nwhere a civil union provides fewer rights than a marriage.\nMost notably, except for those states which\nhave recently passed laws to the contrary, marriage\nin one state is recognized in other states, whereas\nthe same is likely not true of civil unions.  I believe\nthat in the few states that have same-sex civil unions,\nthey have granted most of the same rights as marriage;\nhowever, there are many cases where corporate policies\nhave not followed suit.  For example, if a company\nwould let someone cover their married spouse on the\ncompany medical insurance policy, will they allow that\nsame coverage to a civil union partner?\n\nAs for how to decide if one of the partners should\nchange their last name, I don't have a clue.8	how do u describe sexy??  something that immediatly draws your mind to sex.1	how is it that a spider can make a perfect web with each strand is exactly the same distance between the two?  it depends on the species of spiders.

The causes are varied. It could be due to fibroids(more common in blacks), endometriosis(the lining of the uterus is called the endometrium), infection, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, rarely endometrial cancer and a host of other reasons eg. if you have a bleeding disorder.\n\nYour doctor needs to examine you and would also probably organize an ultrasound scan to check everything is OK. You may also need blood tests to be sure you are not anaemic.\n\nSee the doctor as early as possible. The good news is sometimes no disease process is found and you are simply given medication to reduce the bleeding!3	Is it possible to get high off sharpie?? im jsut wondering cause in art class we r doing this thingy that black and white and i need 2 pick between a regular marker and a sharpie... sharpie would look better but i dont wanna get high in skool!! sure, use spray paint if you wanna get high5	where can i find an image of the robotic looking nfl player,thats shown on fox?? he comes on before commercials on nfl on fox channel. hes wearing a black robotic costume.

I am a Taiwanese girl who is in Grade Eight, and I wanted to study in American High School. There's some questions I would like to ask: \n(1) I am not from a wealthy family. How can I go to an American high school without spending too much money? Since my mom told me that if she provide me to go,  there wouldn't be enough money to go to an American University anymore. \n(2) What is it like in American High School? Is it hard for a Chinese girl like me to make friends with the local people? \n(3) Can someone who had experience this before tell me which is better, go to American High School or University?\nPlease help me with these questions, I am making the biggest choice in my life now. Thanks a lot!!! 1. Public high schools are free to go to here. You only have to pay for private schools. There are also ways to get money help to pay for a university, such as financial aid, student loans and scholarships.\n2. Most people are interested in meeting people from other countries. I'm sure you will have no problem finding friends.\n3. A university is probably better because you have more freedoms, but in America, you go to High School for grades 9-12 and after you graduate from that, then you can go to a University or College.\n\nHope this helps :)6	what is the difference between brand name and trade mark?  A Brand Name is simply the name of a company, product, service, or combination of these. (e.g. Coke, Chevrolet, IBM, Jelly Belly, etc.) If you want to get technical, you can also have "Sub-brands" like Cherry Coke, Diet Coke, etc.\n\nA TradeMark is something entirely different. It's simply a legally protected word or phrase, used to "protect" that word or phrase. Typically protection only applies within a specific business category (e.g. beverages) and within a specific country. The protection prevents others in the industry from using the same phrase. Examples of things that may bear a trademark are brand names, taglines ("The choice of a new generation"), or the names of sub-brands or specific services: "McGriddle". It's also possible to trademark sounds (the ABC tones, the sound of a Harley Davidson engine) and logos (but sometimes with limited success - Harley Davidson was not successful. - the sound was deemed too generic and therefore "not ownable".)\n\nDon't confuse TM with Copyright - A copyright is obtained by registering an entire text, song, or other full proprietary creation like a book, article, lyrics, etc.8	How can you tell, if your partner is having sex regularly, with another woman? during sex how can you tell if your partner, had sex before or had sex during the week/weekend? Apparently, you know how to tell if your partner had sex, because you are asking this question and deep down you already know, but you have turned it into a puzzle to be solved -- even though you already know.  \n\nWell, anyway, if your partner is a man, then you can tell by having sex with him as soon as possible after you suspect he had sex with another woman and then seeing how much semen he has... and compare it to another time when you had sex with him and you are sure that he didn't have sex for 2 days.  Of course, this is not a 100% sure test since he may have masturbated instead while he was away.  But, in either case, you suspect him and that is a bad sign for you in this relationship.5	how do i play basketball next year without killing my coach? i am a 16 year-old female who plays on a team where i am the only one who plays like a guy - in my opinion, the right way to play. the rest play like girls, which is what the coach encourages. i do not understand why she coaches girls - she grew up with 7 brothers, and presently has 5 sons - go figure. she has no real knowledge of working with girls, who are obviously very different from guys. she encourages a social caste system, there is no blending of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors - which makes it extremely difficult to have a team. mistakes are frowned upon, and with one mistake; depending who you are, you're yanked out of the game. if you are not on the top 6 or 7, you are useless to her - and yet she insists upon having a large bench of players. i have had an awful basketball experience, because i am different from the other girls, not only in the way i play but also socially, and the coach does not understand that girls are better coached as GIRLS than boys. Focus on things thay are within your control.  If the way you play is effective and helps the team, continue to play that way.  Although, I'm not sure what you mean by you playing like a guy.  If it means more one-on-one moves then just keep in mind that an offense is in place for a reason.  Take advantage of your opportunities without forcing shots.  Do this and work hard and you can only hope that your coach notices.5	Latinos! whos you favorite...? who's your favorite soccer team? \nChivas\nAmerica \nMorelia\nPachuca\nSantos\nEtc.

Cold, concentrated sulfuric acid is used with neutral, water-insoluble compoinds containing no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  If the compound is unsaturated, is readily sulfonated, or possesses a functional group containing oxygen, it will dissolve in cold concentrated sulfuric acid.  This is frequently accompanied by a reaction such as sulfonation, polymerization, dehydration, or addition of the sulfuric acid to olefinic or acetylenic linkages.  In many cases, however, the solute may be covered by dilution with ice water.2	Are there any braces to push my upper jaw back into place? I live in the UK and i'm still in education (college).

That all depends on what theory you believe. The current theory is that you can go approximately 25 miles down before you hit magma ( that's melted rock in case you don't know ).  Not a good idea, but you may not even get close enough before the intense heat kills you, or you may have some kind of cave in. \nAnother theory is the "Hollow Earth" theory. Supposedly the Earth is more like a shell and great deal inside is hollow, with entrances both at the North and South Poles. There are websites that explain more on this. If this is true, you would dig so many miles in before you go to the great cavern and fall towards the other side.8	How can i get Noelle Baird to love me?  you seem like a stalker.7	Tell me something about life most people don't know.......?

Rhythmic muscle contractions occur in the outer third of the vagina, the uterus and anus. The first muscle contractions are the most intense, and occur at a rate of about 1 per second. As the orgasm continues, the contractions become less intense and occur at a more random rate. \n\nA mild orgasm may have 3 -5 contractions, an intense orgasm 10 -15.\n\nThe "sex flush" (redness) becomes even more pronounced and may cover a greater percentage of the body.\n\nMuscles throughout the body may contract during orgasm, not just those in the pelvic area.\n\nSome women will emit or spray some fluid from their urethra during orgasm. This is often called female ejaculation. \n\nA woman's facial expression may indicate that she is in pain when she is having a pleasurable orgasm.\n\nAt the peak of orgasm the entire body may become momentarily rigid.9	how do I sarch for an inmate in prison?

As an example. In a discussion on TV between a man and a woman, the woman dismissed the man's point by saying 'That is just a white middle class male's view' as though that statement alone was enough to refute the argument. In one phrase she managed to be racist, sexist and classist, yet nobody even blinked.\n\nSo we have a situation where\n\nSex discrimination is OK for women against men\nRace discrimination is OK for blacks against whites\nReligious discrimination is OK for Muslims against Jews and Christians\n\nIt has become just a game of semantics.\n\nYou must not say disabled, you must say differently abled, but that begs the question ' different from what' the obvious answer is different from normal - just as demeaning.5	is there in galactic another planet where people live?

Try this Prana yama breathing exercise, focus your attention on your breathing, ascertain wether you are a upper thorax (shallow breather) or a lower thorax ( deep breather). Most people who suffer from stress and anxiety, will probably find that they are shallow breathers.\nNow sit up straight, adjust your posture to a comfortable position and focus your attention on slowly breathing in deeply, (remember, when you fill a glass with water it fills from the bottom upwards, So should your lungs), as you continue to breathe in you should start to feel first the lower thorax expanding and then the upper thorax expanding, ( do not try to force to much air into your lungs as this may cause discomfort), hold the breath for about 4 seconds and then let your self exhale slowly. Try to achieve a breathing rate of 6 seconds inhalation and 4 seconds holding then 6 second exhalation. Do this exercise for  a few minutes or for as long as is comfortable for you.2	What is "phase 3 depression"? My best friend told me he is entering into phase 3 depression and I have no idea what that is and he won't tell me because he doesn't want me to worry. The only thing I could find on it is that it's the maintenance stage of depression. (Mind you, this isn't an officially accepted psychological concept, it's a drug treatment concept)\n\n"\nMaintenance Phase\nAntidepressant therapy that is prescribed specifically to prevent another episode of depression is called "maintenance therapy." Maintenance therapy may be given to people at high risk of developing depression, since depression often recurs:\n\n    * Once a person experiences a single episode of depression, he or she has a 50% chance of having another.\n    * With two episodes, the chance of recurrence rises to 70%.\n    * With three episodes, the chance of developing depression again is 90%.\n\nMaintenance therapy is used based on the theory that continuing the medication after an initial episode of depression may prevent or lessen the intensity of a subsequent episode.

I also recomend that you read the book that "unlearn34" recomended. But to go further, I was taught that women are more emotional than men(not saying that is bad at all).  Its just that us men have a hard time knowing what we actually feel. It might even take us an entire day before we actually relize what we felt about a certain event the day prior. When my grandfather died I didn't cry or feel any pain for awhile. I sat through the funeral with no emotion at all(that doesn't mean I didn't care for my grandfather, i loved him dearly), it took me a week before i relised that he was gone for good, and then i broke down with tears.  What im trying to get at is we really dont know what we are feeling at the time, its just the way we are.  As for the impossible to understand part, well just find the right guy that you can talk with for hours on end about anything rather than looking for a guy purly on looks. Also some of us are just shy, i know i am and because of that i have a hard time opening up to anyone.2	Please help me. Have a horrid phobia of needles.

My fear has reached a level that i can't control.\n\nLast experience of a needle was horrendus. It took 4 nurses to calm me down. Then because i was in such a state, and hysterical, i was restrained by 3 of them. lol .. (this was getting a blood test) !!!!!!\n  \nSo i am PETRIFIED of the having another one.                      \n\nThis is no exaggeration. Please don't make fun of me. I am really ashamed to be like this.\n\nWhat can i do, to make it easier, and less stressful for myself?\nAlso i tend to hyperventilate, around needles. How can i stop this?\n\nPlease need answers urgently. Thankyou Okay, I am not afraid of needles at all.  I've had blood taken tons of times.  I do however understand having an irrational fear.  I am petrified of driving.  Can you imagine how difficult it is for me to get around?  Yes people make fun of me too.  The only things I can tell you to do to help with the fear are to calm down, think about how millions of people have this done every day and they turn out fine.  Try to control your breathing in fact concentrate on controlling your breathing.  Keep your head turned away and scrunch up your face really tight.  Hopefully this helps.2	What is the difference between abortion and miscarriage?  Abortion is when you intentionally "abort" or get rid of, your fetus (growing baby).

For those of us who are American citizens, this is our inheritance. We have been born into an astonishing country, with astonishing values. And it is our job, as citizens, to help keep alive in whatever small way we can, because, like any inheritance, it can be squandered. And the only thing that will keep it intact is if we, who have been lucky enough to inherit it, try to keep faith with those who bequeathed it to us, and do our best to preserve and enhance it for those who come after us.

Please write the question in a proper manner AND DON'T USE CAPITAL LETTERS IN THAT WAY. It only makes people's head dizzy if you use caps at every single letter of the question.\n\nx^2 + pq + q = 0\n(x - tan(15) )(x - tan(30) ) = 0\nx^2 - x * tan(30) - x * tan(15) + tan(15) * tan(30) = 0\nx^2 - x * (tan(30) - tan(15)) + tan(15) * tan(30) = 0\n\nThus:\npq = - x * (tan(30) - tan(15))\nq = tan(15) * tan(30)\n\nSubstitution.

I just posted the following link;\n\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686\n\nIt describes a systematic study of ALL published research by climatologists in the field of climate change for a TEN year period. They wanted to know how many of the 928 papers disagreed with an international statement as follows;\n\n"the consensus of scientific opinion is that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities: "Human activities ... are modifying the concentration of atmospheric constituents ... that absorb or scatter radiant energy. ... [M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations"\n\nThey found ZERO out of 928 papers disagreed.  When I posted it conservatives said; http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkyrC7JZ8DcRb.HCP5Rd0Frsy6IX?qid=20061102112730AAFtN9W\n\nAre they just not interested in knowing the truth or just plain dumb?\n\nAnd scorbore I checked your links; one is an editorial by a Some of us are interested in the whole truth. 928 papers you think that is even close to all the papers written on the subject that is probably only one years worth. And notice your own quote says "most of the warming" and "is likely" not exactly words you use when you have a proven fact. When I was in college in the 80's we where taught that emissions where leading to an ice age. Global cooling was the concern maybe that is why a large precentage of Americans don't believe in global warming to many theories have been thrown out. I read papers on global warming and I wiegh them against other facts I don't buy it. Claude Allegre, a French scientist who supported the global warming theory 20 years ago and was once a supporter of the Kyoto accords, recently came forward and said it now appears to him that the theory is wrong. Other scientist put him down and said he "was once respectable". How do you explain everyones rush to close out any debate. You talk about conservatives but they are not they ones running around saying the debate is over and falsifying data( The Hockey Stick Graph) How can a scientist at the forefront of your cause defect and you call me ignorant and uninformed. Are you interested in the truth? Or are you more interested in convincing people there is no debate so they don't seek differing opinions.2	Help! Does fruits make one fat? I am watching y weight and one of the advice that I got is 2 eat 5-6 times a day which consists mainly of fruits and vegetables. But I discovered that I am adding weight instead of loosing it and my boyfriend said its because of the fruits (i.e. the fruits are making me fat), but I only take 2 oranges and 1 apple a day. Are they (oranges and apple) responsible for my weight gain? Help! Hi Cleopatra!\n\nFruit and veggies don't cause weight gain, eating more calories then  you burn does.  Thus, I suggest you keep to the 5 meals per day, but keep your total calorie intake to 1500.  Then stay active: dance, shop, walk, play, etc.  Simple rule, fruit has more calories than veggies, so error on that side.\n\nThe should get you started where you could start to see progress within the week if you stick to it.\n\nI believe this answers your question, but if not, you can shoot me an email at: gregg@leandownsite.com\n\nGood luck on your diet and fitness goals!\n\nTrainer Gregg\nYou can achieve anything you set your mind on5	where can i find stats for nfl players that are retired?  http://sportsvl.com/ball/gridironNFL.htm\n\nhttp://www.ffbookmarks.com/nfl_player_profiles_and_organizations.htm7	What do you think of this joke? read on! You want regret it if you read it, trust me. what do you think?? Pocket Taser Stun Gun, a great gift for the wife.\n \nThis was submitted by a guy who purchased his lovely wife a "pocket Taser" for their anniversary.\n\nLast weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest.  The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Toni.  What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser.  The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety....\nWAY TOO COOL!\n\nLong story short, I bought the device and brought it home.  I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing!  I was disappointed.  I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs. Awesome!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.\n\nOkay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?\n\nThere I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target.  I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it.  She is such a sweet cat.  But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised.  Am I wrong?\n\nSo, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.  The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water.  Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.\n\nAll the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, "no possible way!"\n\nWhat happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.......\n\nI'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, "don't do it master," reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!!!\n\nI'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again.  I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs.  The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, "do it again, do it again!"\n\nNote: If you ever feel compelled to "mug" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself.  You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor.  A three second burst would be considered conservative.\n\nSON-OF-A-.... that hurt like hell!!!\n\nA minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at th LOL!! That was one of the funniest stories I've heard in a long time. I like best the part where the guy burst out into saying HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!!

I know the eye works differently from a computer screen, and that we have rods and cones instead of pixels.

Not just clarity or blurriness, but the actual resolution. 0.01 millimeter is the resolution the human eye can detect and differentiate two points as two different point.4	can anyone upload photo to yahoo images? how?  Yes, all you need is a Yahoo! account. \n\nSimply go to Yahoo! Photos, create an album to put the photo in, and upload your pictures from your computer.

I even order prints made from the Yahoo! service. It works great.\n\nGood luck!4	in disk defragment what is contiguous files do or stand for? in disk defragment the contiguous files {blue colored area} is taking up most of my space Disk Fragmentation:\nWindows stores files on your HD in sectors.  there's a file called a File Allocation Table (FAT) that keeps track of the filenames, size, and occupied disk sectors of every file. When you delete a file, Windows doesn't actually delete the data of the file, it just removes it's entry in the FAT, marking those sectors as available.  when you save a new file to your disk, it will find all available sectors, and then overwrite the existing data.  when the file is small enough to fit into a space of available sectors that are phisically together on your disk, that is a contiguous file.  the read/write (R/W) head on your HD doesn't have to jump all over the disk to hunt down all the sectors of a file.  This is a good thing, because it makes accessing your data faster. But sometimes, chunks of avialable sectors don't always match the file size of the file you're saving, so it has to use available sectors elsewhere making the file fragmented {red areas in defrag} and your R/W head has to jump all over your disk to find all the data.  Bad and slow.  Contiguous files are good, and it's the point of fragmentation.  The other colors in Defrag are White, free space, and Green, un-movable files.  The green files are the special files that must occupy the same sectors, like your FAT and Master Boot Record.  And now you know the how and why of Defrag.9	Can someone tell me the marriage laws in China? Im a U.S Citizen living in China at the moment,and plan to get married to a Chinese girl this year.

My son, whos 19, does not take showers regularly enouogh and does not wash his clothes that often, so occationally he stinks.  I go round and round with him every morning just about asking him to please take a shower, please wash your clothes.  Sometimes he does it sometimes he doesn't.  Let me just say that other than that he is a great son.  Never caused us a lick of problems.  But this morning my hubby gave an ultimatum, either my son (his step-son) takes a shower and washes his clothes or he has to move.  I told my husband he was being rediculous.  My son is currently going to college and does not have away to support himself.  My husband said, "its either him or me, you decide!"  I talked to my son, I said, "Please take a shower and wash your clothes when you get home."  And he said he would, but I am still stunned by my husbands ultimatum, what should I do? EASY, tell your husband you choose your son. You are his mother you have a responsibility to him. Your husband is being unreasonable. Sure this is a problem, but this ultimatum was not the solution. Tell him if the ultimatum stands, he needs to leave. Don't abandon your son just because your husband is an a**hole. You will regret it.\nGet rid of the jerk.5	How about them Chiefs?!? 5-3 and looking good! You know I really dissed them early in the season, and especially Herm Edwards.

The problems in Iraq will be solved when the oppressed people of Islam seek a reformation of their own religion, and they can't do that unless there is a champion to help protect them from abuses.  The U.S. is doing that.  Our troops will never come home unless we seriously change the nature of the U.S.  First, we have to become isolationist, and hope the rest of the world doesn't go into a dark age.  Second, we have to train out children to be cowardly and uncaring, so that protecting our own interests and the interests of freedom and democracy go unnoticed around the globe.  Third, we have to silence the people who speak out about the wrongs conducted at an astonishing rate in other countries, and simply listen more to the people who say it is all our fault.\n\nWe can never win this war.  It will never end.  The enemy will just change names, change religions, change ethnicities, change ideologies.  The enemy is ignorance encouraged by "it's not my problem" as an attitude.\n\nAnd we'll always be there to fight it.  You keep speaking up.  Free speech is part of it.  Don't let me silence you, or anyone else silence you.  Free speech may make a liar out of me yet and maybe the rest of the world will join us in letting freedom ring.6	How much freedom does a teacher have? How much freedom does a teacher have, as for as hi or her classroom in concerned. For example, can a teacher put anything they want in the classroom, like a plant, artwork, statues, make the classroom into a particular theme, props, fishtank and so on and so on? Yes they can BUT only if it is considered suitable for the age of the students, not offensive to ethnic/religious/ gender (ect.) issues as approved by the school, and safe.  If you have questions about something - like how will other react to it...it's best to consult another teacher or administrator at your school...since they would know the regs and general attitudes of the community.  IF you are using something to demonstrate that may be offensive - inform the parents before hand, and the school admin so that anyone who doesn't wish to participate can be excused; also apologize to the class at the start of the demonstration and explain why you are using this and that you aware that it might be offensive.\n\n~What I'd like to know is what you want to put up...generally for run of the mill decorations there is no set limits that say you can or can't put something up unless it's dangerous to student.

This makes no sense to me and I don't remember it being that way when I was in high school.  Also, why does the form have to be turned in by a certain deadline, and then they are stuck taking the tests even if they don't want to?  I thought ASVAB's were tests for the military? I just didn't attend school the day they gave it, and never made it up.  My sister took it and recruiters were calling all the time.  My kids aren't in high school yet, but if that is how they do things, I would call the school and tell them my child is not taking it.

I have a could right now. Generally when I get sick, it is bronchitis, but this time it is a little different. I still have a "croopy" cough, but it is not in my chest, though it sounds weird, it seems to be more in my throat.\n\nAnyhow, I was looking in the mirror to see if my throat has swollen. I noticed to the left (my left, not in the mirror) of the thing that hangs down, there is a lump the size of a pea. It comes before the "ridge" that sticks down just behind the hangy thing. (Sorry for the lack of terms, it is late)\n\nAnyhow, I was wondering what this may be. I think, I can't quite remember, I have seen it before, so I'm not sure if it has to do with my cold.

Well, I've managed to do it twice.  Each time it started with talking about her sexual fantasys.  The common fantasy was about them interacting with another woman. This led to hot bedroom action.  Next, watch movies that have hot sex scenes and discuss them.  Talk about how they made her feel emotionally.  Try "Wild Things" or something similar for the girl on girl action.  Follow that with more great sex. Through the movies, I learned that both were curious about strip clubs and we went together and watched.  Again, hot action followed back at home.  It is incremental -- you have to do it slowly and gradually.  Women's desires aren't that far off from men's.  You must make a woman feel safe in her environment and in their relationship with you or it probably isn't going to happen.  If it doesn't, you will have had a lot of great sex trying, so you are out absolutely nothing.2	why do we do what we do and regret it later?  Humans work on behaviors. They are learned and just a part of our personality. What we need to learn is that we all have what we call "automatic thoughts". Just use an automatic thought record. That is stop recognize the quick "automatic thought" that comes to you first when posed with a situation or conversation, Think about the emotion attatched to it and then think about what you are to do next. That would be the action, what you do next. By keeping a thought record of this line of thinking, over time you will learn to catch yourself before you have a regret, be it a word that was cutting or an action. I hope that this helps. What it all boils down to is "think before you react" and understand why you feel the way you do.8	i love a girl but she dont love me yet she has promised me to marry me only. will she love me from deep heart? hi\ni am divyank pathak age-- 17\ni want to tell you my love story and want solution. hope you would help me best.\ni know a girl (age--16) from childhood. we were friends but not so close.\ni started loving her a year back, and when i proposed her she accepted it. then she told me that she loved a boy who left him alone, and will love her till the end of her life. she says that i are my love but he is her true love.\nshe have promised me that she will marry me only. we understand each other very well. she tell that her heart dont allow her to marry anyone but she wants a support. when i came to know that she dont love me, she always think about the her love and will continue to do so, i was heartbreaked knowing this. but i accepted her but not happy at all.\nwill she ever love me from deep heart?\nwhat should i do now? Divyank, marriage should be a commitment of ones love for each other...it sounds like your chosen partner is sincere but for the wrong reasons, she needs someone that can support her, that would be you, but her heart belongs to another...I understand in some cultures marriages are arranged based on who can be the best provider, but what I hear your words speak is that you also want a loving relationship too...and thats the part that I understand...I do not feel your going to get this from your partner...her accepting without loving you is one thing, that may develop later, however, accepting your proposal and already loving someone else may not ever change...you will live with a broken heart that she can not truly mend...everyone deserves to be happy...look for a partner who loves you...and allow her to seek her own happiness elsewhere...good luck.0	Why is it that some animals eat their young, but people don't?  sadly society frowns on this.

Both American football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, and American football is directly descended from rugby football.\n\nMcGill University athletes, who had learned rugby from the local British Army garrison, introduced the sport to the U.S. with a game against Harvard University in 1874. The game quickly spread to other Ivy League colleges.\n\nEncouraged by Yale University's Walter Camp, the schools began to adopt rules that would differentiate American football from rugby in the 1880s. The scrimmage was introduced in 1880 and the system of downs in 1882.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, football had become notoriously dangerous; 18 college players died in 1905 alone. Colleges responded with a series of rule changes to open up the game, most importantly the forward pass, along with outlawing dangerous formations such as the "flying wedge", and introducing and requiring better equipment such as helmets.\n\nThe game had achieved its modern form by 1912, when the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. Originally dominated by the Ivy League, football soon captured the interest of colleges nationwide. By 1916, when the Rose Bowl game matching eastern and western teams became an annual event, football had developed a national following second only to baseball among team sports.\n\nProfessional football developed in the mill towns of Pennsylvania and the American Midwest in the early years of the 20th century. The NFL was founded in 1920 in Canton, Ohio. Professional football remained a largely regional sport of secondary importance until after World War II. Television broadcasts greatly enhanced NFL football's national appeal, and the pro game surpassed both college football and baseball in popularity in the 1960s. The first Super Bowl—between the champions of the NFL and the rival American Football League—was played in 1967, and the two leagues merged in 19703	Where can I find the poetic meaning of the poem "The Sleeper in the Valley" translated by William Jay Smith?

I admit, this sounds kind of mean, but I have to ask. It's driving me crazy. I've been friends with this girl since fifth grade, and we used to be such good friends. But she has become kind of demanding and sulky over the years, and it's kind of like she depends on me for her happiness. Her attitude been getting a liiiiittle bit better, but not as much as I would like, because I feel really annoyed whenever I'm around her, even if she doesn't do anything wrong at the moment. This is being super mean, I know, especially because I hardly look at her whenever I talk or listen to her. And when she calls me I always get super exasperated, even when it's about homework. How should I tell her (in a mature way) to stop hanging around with me so much? I've already tried once recently, but it doesn't seem like it worked.

The Egyptian pyramids were built using an enormous labour force - ordinary citizens served for a few months of each year to work as well as full time craftsmen who worked to build the monuments.  Typically, a king began construction of his pyramid complex soon after ascending the throne and construction continued until his death.\nThe earliest pyramids were solid stone structures.  After a sight was selected and prepared, the foundation was laid with large blocks being dragged in on sledges - a sort of sled-like vehicle.  As the pyramid rose, a ramp was used to move blocks into place higher up the structure.  Frequently, local stone was used for the interior blocks of the pyramid and finer stone was brought from special sources for the exterior casing of the pyramid.\nIn later pyramids, the core was frequently not of solid stone but of rubble or mudbrick with an outer facing of nicer stone.  Eventually pyramids were constructed primarily of mudbrick rather than stone.2	Have you had a colposcopy with a biopsy.  Did it really hurt or was it just uncomfortable for you?

It is a long way from Star Trek, but teleportation - the disembodiment of an object in one location and its reconstruction in another - has been successfully carried out in a physics lab in Australia. \nScientists at the Australian National University (ANU) made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away. \n\nWhen physicists teleported photons for the first time in 1997 they had to destroy the photons to be sure that the teleportation had been successful. Now a team at the University of Vienna has managed to teleport photons without destroying them. Jian-Wei Pan and colleagues believe that their method could be the next step towards long-distance quantum communication (J-W Pan et al. 2003 Nature 421 721).\n\nIn quantum teleportation the sender, normally called Alice, instantaneously transfers the quantum state of a particle to a receiver, called Bob. In most experiments so far Alice has teleported the quantum state of a photon - defined in terms of its polarization - to Bob. The photon itself is not transferred: rather Bob’s photon acquires exactly the same polarization as Alice’s. The uncertainty principle means that Alice cannot know the exact state of her photon, but another feature of quantum mechanics called “entanglement” means that this is not an obstacle to teleporting the state to Bob. \n\nQuantum entanglement essentially allows two particles to behave as one, regardless of how far apart they are. Photons can be entangled so that if one is vertically polarized, for instance, then the other photon in the pair is always horizontally polarized. \n\nIn a standard teleportation experiment a laser is directed at a crystal with nonlinear optical properties. Occasionally the photon will be “down-converted” into two lower energy photons, and sometimes these photons will have their polarizations entangled. In a teleportation experiment the beam is reflected back through the crystal to sometimes produce a second pair of entangled photons. By convention the photons in the first pair are labelled 2 and 3 (for mode 2 and mode 3), and those in the second pair are 1 and 4. Photons 1 and 2 are directed to Alice, photon 3 is sent to Bob and photon 4 is used as a trigger. A variety of mirrors, beamsplitters and polarizers are used to direct the photons to four detectors labelled D1, D2, D3 and T (for trigger). \n\nThe aim of the experiment is to transfer, or teleport, the polarization of photon 1 to photon 3. This is normally done by making a joint measurement on photons 1 and 2 which changes the polarization of the latter in such a way that photon 3 - which is entangled with it - always acquires the same polarization as the first photon. In other words the quantum state of photon 1 - which was unknown to Alice - has been teleported to photon 3. \n\nThe experiment was set up such that detectors D1, D2 and T all register photons at the same time when teleportation takes place. However, under certain circumstances - the emission of two photons each into modes 1 and 4 - it is possible for the same three detectors to register events even though there is no photon in mode 3 to teleport to. These spurious events mean that the D3 detector must also register - and destroy - a photon to be sure that teleportation has taken place. \n\nBy using a filter to reduce the intensity of the photons that are going to be teleported the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of spurious detection events. The Vienna team could be 97% certain that the state had been teleported to photon 3 without actually having to detect it. Such a high accuracy means that the teleported photons could be used in “quantum repeaters” for long distance communication. The team now hopes to combine these results with a technique known as “entanglement purification” to further develop quantum communication over long distances.\n\n\n\nThe achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible, at3	what are the residency rules for Chicago public shool teachers?

I have an upcomming debate for english on abortion.  Can someone tell me the pros and cons of abortion? The question as to whether & when abortion might be right should be largely a scientific question!\n\nWHEN DOES LIFE BEGIN!\n\nBefore life begins - \nIt is OBVIOUSLY a woman's right to have an abortion.\n\nAfter life begins -\nIt is OBVIOUSLY killing a human to have an abortion.\n\nNot that makes things simple, but that should be the basis of the argument.\n\nThe arguments on both side are frequently emotional and not thought out.\n\n"Choose life; your mother did." The same logic can be applied to not using birth control.\n\n"It's not fair to bring an unwanted baby into the world."\nHaven't you heard of how many people are on a long list for adopting a child? This goes for all races now days. This argument only applies to handicapped kids. Then I wonder, couldn't you apply the same logic to the children after they're born? What is the scientific difference between a late-term fetus and a new-born baby?\n\n"The baby you want to abort could be the next Albert Einstein or Martin Luther King" or maybe the next Hitler.\n\n"My Body - My Choice" But the fact of the matter is (at least at some stage of the development) there is another human life IN your body. And in the vast majority of the cases, the woman had a choice before getting pregnant! Birth Control!\n\nYou may religiously believe life begins at conception, but you can't legislate by religion. \n\nAnd just because it isn't fair for a woman to have to have a baby she didn't want just because she waited to long into the pregnancy to make the decision, does that mean it's fair to kill the baby?\n\nEven in cases of rape or incest, the question of whether the fetus is a human life, or a lump of tissue should central.   I'm not trying to minimize the hell a woman would go through in this situation, I'm just saying the baby doesn't cease to be a baby (IF development is that far along).\n\nSo what I'd like to see is SCIENTIFIC DATA to determine when life begins.0	who is the best friend in the life?  for me, my life partner7	Can you take a hint?

Daniel and Andrew Inman bought 400 acres of Old Town Danville with their mining earnings in 1854, after living here for a summer two years earlier. By 1858, the community boasted a blacksmith, a hotel, a wheelwright and a general store and the townsfolk wanted a post office.\n\n"But what should the community be called?  In an article years later,  Dan Inman said "quite a number (of names) were suggested." He and Andrew rejected "Inmanville," finally settling on Danville. According to the modest Dan, the name was chosen as much or more out of respect for Andrew's mother-in-law who was born and raised near Danville, Kentucky. Of course it also recognized the energetic young Dan who was later an Alameda County Assemblyman and Supervisor."1	What is the best book, resource, treatise, summary, paragraph, or statement on the subject of entropy?

I searched for "Mennonite Halloween" on line, and came across a few individual congregations that were having youth parties, like other Christian denominations, on Halloween.  One group had this to say, and I thought it was a pretty good answer to your question:\n"Many families celebrate Halloween but they often do so by having parties in their homes for children, or church youth groups plan special parties for the evening.  There are also Mennonite groups who believe that it is wrong to celebrate Halloween because they believe that it has evil connotations … the celebration of evil spirits, etc. Most conservative groups would not celebrate Halloween because they would consider it foolish and a “worldly” activity.

However....If you don't have a problem in that area then i would steer clear of those types of medications....what they do is increase the bloodflow to the vascular tisue of the penis. increasing the bloodflow for someone who doesn't have blood flow issues can possible stretch out the blood vessles in the penis, permanently damaging it...then the bloodflow that you usually had won't cause the penis to become errect and you'll be unable to maintain an erection without the aid of viagra...hence fowarth becomming dependant on it to fill the larger blood vessles. can also cause pyrines disease which is a curvature of the penis causes by stretching and scaring of the blood vessles in the penis.....just be careful bro.4	i have digital camera Olympus(Japnes made ) Model C800L i lost its driver Any One Can Help me? i want both driver & Software\nOlympus Model C-800L Camedia n7	who is the greatest american rock band?

Why do people choose to be fundamentalist?\nWhy not keep an open mind and wonder about things beyond word for word definintions of everything in the Bible?\nWas the Bible made to be easy or does it have a cryptic meaning for the wise to find?` "Let him who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches". Revelation 3:6\n\nJesus foretold that anyone who was truly searching for the Truth would find Enlightenment in The Word. One has to have the heart of a child: meek, humbled, and willing to fully comprehend it, and even then we fall sadly short.\n\nMatthew 11:25-- "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes"\n\nI discourage the dogma of fundamentalism which says "this is how I was raised to believe such and such a verse..."\n\nThe Bible was written in such a way that the wise are confounded, yet the pure and simple hearted can easily percieve it's profound truth. \n\nThe Word of God is far from cryptic concerning Biblical principles and standards of living (like abortion, homosexuality, marriage, finances etc.)\n\nSo when you say "keep an open mind"--it doesn't mean that we let ourselves accept man's errent translations/transliteration, but it does mean that we keep our hearts sensitive to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who teaches us all things.\n\nJohn  16:13-- "When the Spirit of Truth is come (that is, the Holy Spirit), he will guide you into all truth"\n\nwith all that said, some people choose to remain stubborn fundamentalists because either they:\n1) have already received an inner witness that what they believe is right OR--\n2)are too full of fear to even consider any doctrine that vary's from what they have tradtionally been taught.2	What are the benefits of drinking green tea?

Certainly this young man should suffer consequences for interrupting your performance. Whether your performance is as a club or as an athletic team (as the cheer squad at your school), he has no right to disrupt the pep assembly in that manner. \n\nYes, it was an insult to your group. Yes, you are compatible/equal to the cheerleaders. Many schools' dance teams started out as yours is doing: as an informal/intra-mural "club"/after-school activity and grew into a teacher/school-sponsored activity that is "legitimate" and eventually competes against other schools in inter-scholastic competition. \n\nUnfortunately, the punishment that he receives is not up to you and your group members. My suggestion to you would be to have your parents contact the administration and have THEM explain your and their frustration and disapoointment that another student would disrupt a performance of fellow students. The parents of the dance group  should also say that they expect some form of punishment that is somewhat severe for this young fellow since this is the second year in a row he has interrupted a pep rally. They should also emphasize how demoralizing it is for their daughters to have to experience this type of humiliation in front of the whole student body, when their daughters are trying to expose their fellow students to dance and rhythm. \n\nYou are not whacked -- he is!\n\nGood luck...3	i want to be a nurse...if u have any info or if ur a nurse could u please contact me thanks? my email address is rsutter87@hotmail.com i would really appreciate it if u could help me, u would change my life. this is my only way of getting info. thanks Try the university of teesside.

Vexation is a feeling of\n            disquietude or irritating uneasiness from numerous\n            causes, such as losses, disappointments, etc.\n            Mortification is a stronger word, and denotes that\n            keen sense of pain which results from wounded pride or\n            humiliating occurrences. Chagrin is literally the\n            cutting pain produced by the friction of Shagreen\n            leather; in its figurative sense, it varies in\n            meaning, denoting in its lower degrees simply a state\n            of vexation, and its higher degrees the keenest sense\n            of mortification. "Vexation arises chiefly from our\n            wishes and views being crossed: mortification, from\n            our self-importance being hurt; chagrin, from a\n            mixture of the two."                    --Crabb.\n            [1913 Webster]3	what is a scholarship? i dont udnerstand what a scholar ship is please tell me.

Probably not.  The clue is that you know the words and can read and understand when you read silently.  Is your everyday speech also a bit " weird"?  If so, get a consultation with a speech therapist.  If you speak fluently, but read a little disjointed, consult an experienced reading teacher.\nMany people get nervous when reading aloud.  It could just be a knee jerk reaction from a bad school read aloud experience.  You may benefit from some breathing/punctuation instruction and practice. The Read Naturally program has great, and relatively inexpensive, materials at various grade levels to elp with reading fluency.  The program comes with CDs so the reader can listen to models and then practice reading along with the person on the CD. \n You could also use a Talk Back ( or Tok Bak etc. )   which is simple device which you can make easily for yourself with some PVC pipe which looks similar to old fashioned phone receiver ( pre cell phone).   You hold this up to your mouth and ear and read into it.  You can instantly hear what you sound like to others.   Finally, you can read into a tape recorder and listen to yourself to see if you can spot where the porblem area is.  I have some clients who read and understand well, but stumble over long words.  Another has a poorly repaired cleft palate which makes it difficult for her to breathe through her nose. What is more important ?  To be able to read and understand  or to sound great when you read aloud?  Unless you have a job that requires this,just accept that this is the way you are and move on.   If you have a personal reason for wanting to read more fluently, like perhaps you want to read to children, then try one of the strategies we have already mentioned.   Good luck2	how do i reduce my weight?  Try walking, running, moving in general for a half an hour a day. Don't let up. Pep talks always help me. Don't eat when you're not hungry and drink plenty of water. Don't deny yourself the foods you want. Just eat them in moderation and slowly your body won't want fatty or sugary foods. But if you deny yourself a candy bar or something like that, you're more likely to cheat on your diet and/or binge eat.7	Morning Peeps... See what happened when I rang BABy's home this mrng?

"Is your daddy home?" \n"YES," whispered the small voice.\n"May I talk with him?"\n“NO”\n"Is your Mommy there?"\n“YES”\n"May I talk to her?"\nAgain BABy whispered, “NO”\nMe wishing to leave a message,  "Is anybody else there?"\n"YES," he whispered, "A COPE."\nWondering what a cop would be doing at BABy’s home, I  asked, "May I speak with the cop?"\n"NO, HE'S BUSY", whispered the BABy.\n"Busy doing what?"\n"Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman," came the whispered answer.\nGrowing concerned and even worried as hearing what sounded like a chopper through the earpiece I asked, "What is that noise?"\n"A hello-copper" BABy whispering.\nNow truly alarmed I asked. "What is going on there?" \nIn an awed whispering voice the BABy answered, "The search team just landed the hello-copper."\nAlarmed& more concerned me asked, "What r they searching?\nStill whispering, BABy replied along with giggle: \n"FOR ME."

She's still cold as an iceberg and manipulative with her mouth. How do I control this woman before I crack? Well Smooooooooth (why exactly are you using that name and then bashing your wife publicly...I don't know that I would consider that particularly "Smooth") - looks like she's frustrated, and if I were you, I would concentrate on doing those little things she's been askin' you to do. \n\nRemember the one most important rule of a happy marriage:  A happy wife equals a happy life!\n\nMost likely she's not asking for much, but it's just enough to inconvenience you - so you ignore it, and put it off until you just can't avoid it anymore.  That in turn pisses her off and causes a crappy attitude.  It's called give and take.  If she does things for you - you should be doing things for her.\n\nDon't ignore her or try to beat her down- maybe you should listen to why she's so angry.

I posted a link below to see what a matrix plot looks like.\n\nOf course you really can't see a normal distribution on a scatter plot.  If you add up the students exams or take the mean, you can draw a histogram of the data to get an idea what the distribution looks like.  It's possible that they are normally distributed, but it depends on the exams and the skill level of the class.  If one exam is easy, then its distribution would be skewed to the left (meaning it has a left tail), which would not be normal-looking.  Same thing with hard exams except those would be skewed to the right.  Then also, since classes are not selected randomly and the tests are different, you cannot be assured that the Central Limit Theorem will hold for the means, especially since you are only taking the means of 5 tests, but it is possible that you will.5	list of newcastle united players 1980 to 2006?

Sometimes this can happen from cramping, otherwise Spasticity (muscle spasms) tends to affects larger areas of the body - arm, leg, trunk, neck.. Which is what it sounds like you had/have.\nHere is a little information on muscle spasms in this is the case. \nhttp://www.alsa-or.org/treatment/MuscleSpasms.htm\n\nAs for what Fuschiahedgehog said above\nThat is just absurd to say "Could be anything from a seizure to a stroke" who seems to think they are a doctor.\nRidiculous!\nHere are the signs of a stroke to better educate yourself... I can almost see "Seizure" because epilepsy causes muscle spasms/seizures which can cause an arm to shake out of control, but usually there are more signs of a seizure than just that:\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4742\n\n\nAnyways, you are better off seeing a doctor other than reading what others have to say who have no medical background.\n\nEdit:\nFrom reading all of your questions I would strongly suggest you see a doctor right away... Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well.4	can i fix my dell laptop m40 myself, as I know that the memory has gone?

Congress's last serious attempt to reduce wasteful spending occurred in 1995 and 1996, when the 104th Congress terminated several programs whose irrelevance was proven by how quickly they were forgotten. But Congress then committed several strategic errors, such as overreaching and shutting down the federal government in 1995. After President Bill Clinton deftly exploited theses mistakes, budget cutters overreacted to Clinton's tactics by completely abandoning the mission of smaller government. Federal spending subsequently skyrocketed as a paralyzed Congress decided that budget confrontations with the Clinton White House could never be won and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nIn 2003, reducing wasteful spending is more important than ever. Defense, homeland security, and expensive entitlements are stretching the federal government thin while a high tax burden is weighing down the economy. Yet, although President Clinton is no longer in office and budget-cutting strategies have improved, Congress and (albeit to a lesser extent) President Bush still maintain a reflexive fear of attacking wasteful spending.\n\nIt is time to step back and think about the role of government, the obligations of the private sector, and the delineation between federal and state responsibilities.5	who was the FIRST winner of the premiership ?

I know the general syptoms and what they look like, but are they still relavent today with modern medicine? Bedsores are still very much a common occurance.  Also called pressure ulcers.

So if some lies on their side for days and days or even weeks their skin in that particular area will not get the blood flow that it needs (nutrition)  and it will start to break down. They can be horrible extremely big and very hard to heal.  Another common area for bedsores is the heel of the foot and the lower back.  These areas get alot of pressure/lack of nutrition.

No, God did not procreate with Mary in the same way that man procreates, He did create His Son in Mary through the immaculate conception of His Holy Spirit. Thus, Jesus was born in the Spirit, making him man and God.1	what is the immunity out side of your body?  Huh? I'm not sure what your first langauge is, but your question makes no sense whatsoever in English.\n\nI'm trying to decipher it and I THINK you might be trying to ask about herd immunity. Does that sound right?\n\n____\n>>>>Immunity outside would consits of skin, \n>>> nostrils and fillaments within the ears.\n\nNo, it wouldn't. Those aren't immunity, they are simply barriers. Nostrils aren't even that, they are just holes.\n\nI think perhaps you should find a dictionary and look up "immunity".3	what is the use of having computer ?  You are asking "What is the use of having computer?".\n\nFlash Back - Time Magazine\n\nThe magazine's most famous feature over its eighty years has been the annual Person of the Year (formerly Man of the Year) cover story, in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news. Despite the title, the recipient is not necessarily an individual — for instance, in 1983 the personal computer was recognized as "Machine of the Year".\n\nOct. 5, 1983 \n\nThe Computer Moves In By the millions, it is beeping its way into offices, schools and homes WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME, the bright red advertisement asks in mock irritation, WHAT A PERSONAL COMPUTER CAN DO? The ad provides not merely an answer, but 100 of them. A personal computer, it says, can send letters at the speed of light, diagnose a sick poodle, custom-tailor an insurance program in minutes, test recipes for beer. As the Apple Computer advertisement indicates, the enduring American love affairs with the automobile and the television set are now being transformed into a giddy passion for...

Also why we call God as him but not her?  Introduction to God:\nThere is only one God as the Holy Bible says. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! (Deuteronomy 6:4) We also know that the Bible gives attributes of deity to God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit of God. We also know that there are not three God’s, they are One.\n\nTrying to explain God with human understanding is very limited, because we are limited. We can only know about God by what He has revealed to us in His written Word, the Holy Bible. The Bible gives us enough information to know that we can trust God with our lives and believe that His word is truth. But we cannot understand all that there is to know about God from our human perspective.\n\nMan is created in the image of God so we can understand some things about God by looking at ourselves. There are three parts to humans we have a spirit, and a soul, and they are contained in a physical body, but they are one person. Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (1STThessalonians 5:23) The following is a crude human analogy of God but it seems to fit with what we are taught in the Bible about God. The soul would relate to God the Father. The body would be Jesus the Christ, and the spirit of God would be the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe soul is a spiritual being, it is the mind, the heart, the control center of a person, the personality, it is the person. God the Father is Spirit. "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." (John 4:24) \n\nJesus the Christ represents the body of God; He is God in physical form. For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, (Colossians 2:9). Just as the body receives and obeys commands from the soul, or mind, Jesus receives and obeyed commands from the Father. Jesus said that He only did what He saw the Father do and He only said what He heard the Father say. Then Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things. (John 8:28) Jesus was a sinless example of how we are supposed to be, in total obedience to the Father. The body is subject to the mind or soul.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Spirit of love. I believe that the Holy Spirit unites the Father and Son as One; One in love, One in will, One in personality. The spirit that God has given man is what the world calls our conscience. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it. (Ecclesiastes 12:7) The spirit that God has given man is our source of life, (John 6:63). The moment that the spirit that God has given us departs from our body we are dead, (James 2:26).\n\nOur spirit gives us understanding of truth from God. But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding. (Job 32:8) Our spirit is always trying to unite us with God through Jesus Christ, who is the only way to God. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him." But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. (1 Corinthians 2:9-11) Our spirit is the only part of our being that we can trust. Our spirit reveals truth to us in the way that God sees truth. The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the innermost parts of his being. (Proverbs 20:27) \n\nHuman souls have inherited corruption from Adam’s sin, (Romans 5:12). Because a person is born a sinner he cannot trust his own soul, which is his heart. The natural tendency of our soul is to sin. Sin is disobedience to God a2	Do you think tattoos and body piercings are worth having?  Plz tell me wat u think.?

First you need to accept her death, yeah i know its hard but its life. Then u need to accept that u have to move on. You cant stay like this forever. Ask yourself whether she would like to see u in such a state. I dont think she would. Its too early to start dating again but go out and meet your friends and try to have a nice time. You will never forget her, that is for sure, but maybe one day u will find som1 else. Just dont hurry to do that.\nBtw, am sure she wont be unhappy if you find another GF. She loves you a lot, am sure she wants your happiness.\nIf I were dead, I wouldn't want my BF to live a sad life without me.

I was told DSL gives you less megs..but you dont share this with others..so it's a better deal. Is this true? Cable is like a series of pipes...you open more taps and the water flow slows. DSL is direct... no other pipes.And cable, you are connected to the other "pipes" so they are also connected to you. Make sure you have a firewall. DSL is fast and not slowed by that flow and more secure.\nAnd guess what? The US Government thinks so to.

This seems the best of you suggestions thus far.\n\nD) This will get you arrested for vandalism, though I can understand your anger.\n\nRegarding politicans, the vast majority were once lawyers.  As we all know, most lawyers are the scum of the earth, especially those driven by a lust of power, which consequently are the only ones that endeavor for political position.  Other politicians come from business backgrounds, who are also driven by a lust of power.  So, regardless of the politician or party, they all suck.2	what is the fastest way to fight a cold?  a hot bath with (i don't know how to say this) big sault, two aspirins, and a very warm bed to sleep and sweat in. a lot of fluids, mostly tea, no getting out of the house or even from bed, but take some walks inside the house, eat soups and even a cup of hot red wine.2	how big is the aveage sized penis?

Now me and my girl have a big fight because of an appearance of the third person. Now she is confused whether she loves me or him. How can i get her back? She have given me another chance to prove to her that she still love me. If i can prove that she still loves me she promise to be with me once again. Please help me i cannot lose her. I can't lose her. Tell me how can i get her heart again? I really love her and i can't lose her. I rather die tha losing her. Get shitfaced drunk, stand outside her window and scream out you love her.  She should come crawling back in no time.\n\nShe needs to prove to herself if she loves you.  Not you proving it to her.  If she has second thoughts, then she's not in love with you.  Move on.  Quit whining about it.  There are worse things in this world to worry about than you girlfriend.0	Where does the phrase "but thats another kettle of fish" come from?  We still do have fish kettles in Britain.  They are long oval pans which can sit across two burners - big enough to take 'the one that got away'!  \n\nThey have lids, and my stepmother's is a pretty fish kettle as it is shiny stainless steel.\n\nPerhaps the phrase comes about because one thing you would never do is cook two different types of fish in the same kettle as their flavours would taint each other.  Each has to be cooked (considered) separately.9	The first warrant for Osama Bin Laden's arrest was issued by Interpol in 1998.

The top part of your nail that grows away from your finger. That's the part where the new nail is growing- underneath the existing nail.  It is white, because it is not laying against the skin, as the rest of the nail is.  The skin has blood vessels under it, which tint the skin pink, which is why that part of the nail is pink.  If you notice, the end of the nail is white, too, because that is no longer laying on skin.9	Why is the left side of Senator John McCain's face swollen? Does he have a tumor, or did he?

Et ce n'est pas l'arbitre qui empêchent les Français de mettre un essai lors de chacune des trois pénaltouches à 5m de la ligne d'essai des Blacks.\nIls étaient trop forts, trop rapides, trop puissants, trop techniques, trop bonne vision du jeu (essai de Carter sur la droite de l'attaque, alors que 7 défenseurs Bleus vont défendre le côté gauche), tout le temps à 4 pour récupérer le ballon, \nTROP BONS !!

For ten months, I have been engaged to her. We were living togather. I came home from work, and she was gone. At first I gave her a letter witch wasnt so nice, out of hurt. Then I sent her another leter witch told my true feelings. She called me, and we decided to go talk. I found out that she still loved me, but she just could not be with me anymore. I had not given her the physical and emotional suport she needed. When I talk to her, she seems happy to see me, but when I say to much she starts crying. I asked her to please come home. she wont. I have tried not to be pushey or overbaring with her, and give her space. I think she might also be interested in another man. She still calls me baby.  With what she has told me, I am not sure she really wanted to leave in the first place. I think she felt she had no other choice, as strange as that might sound. I am trying to regain our relationship, but everything I am doing isn't working, any thoughts on what to do. However much you want it, you can't force a person to be with you, or change their mind.  If she wanted to be with you, she would have stayed, and she would be with you now.\n\nIt sounds like she is very confused and going through some troubles of her own.  I would suggest just leaving her alone and giving her some space.  Perhaps when she has had time to get her head sorted out, she may decide to come back.  I think calling her and writing to her just adds pressure and may drive her away.  Try reverse psychology here.  If you just stop trying to contact her, she may contact you.  Then you have more control over the situation.  You can then tell her to either make up her mind or leave you alone.8	i dont undertand my close girl friend, do i have to keep my self a little bit distance from her or what i do? at first were hanging out together w/ this guy our classmate and they both have mutual feelings i know that and were aware that my close girl friend has already bf for almost 2+ yrs and still we do go out having fun she even neglect his bf coz she wanted to enjoy have fun and as her friend i understand to accompanied her until they broke w/ his bf and later still go out w/ the guy our classmate i feel guilty towards the situation if not by me she wont be into this or isnt my fault? and i feel like i dont wanna be w/ her coz i dont want she would end up w/ that guy as long as theyre friends its oky but its possible they have feelings towards each other. what would i do? what should i tell her? im just concerned! just be yourself be honest and tell her the truth0	why do to many people are redo when they answer question?  ...eh?6	How do you get up a level?

I asked this question earlier in the society section but think I will get a more interesting set of answers here. Social pressure is an issue, but the key is social gradient.  Men need something to give them an “advantage” in the relationship so we know the woman will respect us: we want to be older, richer, more educated…\n\nBlack woman are often perceived as move aggressive or strong and this threatens the social gradient.  Therefore I would guess that White & Asian men avoid dating black woman because they are uncertain that she will respect him.2	i have to take a drug test soon. ill be off pot 26 days, been drinking 3-4litres of water a day. will i pass?

No matter what, it's going to stay in your hair (including all your body hair) for several months.\n\nWhy not just quit the drugs forever??1	why proteins fold?  The main force behind folding is that hydrophobic side chains on some amino acids repel water.  If they are surrounded by water, the system is at a higher energy state than if they are away from water.  Thus, they attact each other, and end up inside the core of the coiled polypeptide chain, with water molecules contacting only charged (polar / ionised) side chains, which end up on the outside.\n\n(This applies to proteins which will be active in aqueous emvironments.  With proteins that will sit in hydrophobic environments, such as in biological membranes, the folding works to keep hydrophobic side chains exposed.)\n\nThen, the positively - charged side chains are attracted to the negatively - charged ones.\n\nFinally, the cysteines that end up near each other may oxidise, turning their -S-H chains into _S_S_ disulfide bridges.  That is; these form late, but then they are stable covalent bonds, and so they do increase the final stability of the 3D folded conformation of the protein.\n\nIt is the 3D structure that gives proteins their biological function.8	Do you think its better to lose a lover or love a loser?

If you are in doubt, refer to the manual that came with the drive or on the box.\n\nUsually, the jumpre has to be set to slave since the hard drive is the master.  If you have two IDE cables there are 4 options: Primary master and primary slave and Secondary master and secondary slave.  Your hard drive usually will be connected to  primary master.  So, depending upon your choice and any other connected drives set the appropriate option and jumper settings.  These settings are mentioned on the drive itself.  First verify the jumper settings of your hard drive.1	Thunderstorms formation?  what about them?\n\ngreat pic and explanation here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm0	Do you believe in what Dan Brown said about the Last Supper?

Point Guard-Okay this player is the most important to the team. Not necessarily the best but he is the most important.\nfirst this person should have good ball handling skills and must be able to see the court better than anyone on the team. Vision is very important.He also needs to be a good passer because he is going to be the man guy who distributes the ball.\n\nShooting Guard-Now a lot of times this is the best player on the team.(if you look to the history of the NBA and presnt, like Jordan,Kobe, Wade, Lebron). This person should have a good shot and should be able to drive to the basket.\n\nSmall Foward-Well he is the guy inthe middle. He should be able to driblle (at least descent), rebound, drive and sometimes post up.\n\nPower Foward- This guy rebounds and is also accounted to score points down low and blocks shots. They also should be able to set a pick since they usually set the most picks/screens.\n\nCenter-This guy rebounds,blocks, scores down low.4	how the computer process?  it has on and off switches, each one tells the computer to go a certain way, the operating system interprates what the processor means, and then puts it into the monitor driver which sends an image to you, so you know whats going on (sort of)1	Errors in Kaplan 2006 AP Chem book?

I see faith as being a belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence and spirituality as, well, I think Sam Harris sums it up pretty well: "'Spirituality' or "mysticism" (both words are pretty terrible, but there are no good alternatives in English) refers to any process of introspection by which a person can come to realize that the feeling he calls "I" is a cognitive illusion. The core truth of mysticism is this: It is possible to experience the world without feeling like a separate "self" in the usual sense. Such a change in the character of one's experience need not become the basis for making unsupportable claims about the nature of the universe, however." Faith, as it is found in Christianity, is a cop out to really trying to understand the nature of the universe.  In Buddhism, the monks tell you not to take anything without evidence.  Why?  Because they are seeking the truth.  And, you do not find the truth by following things without evidence.  Spirituality, is developed when you discover a little more about the nature of our relationship to the infinite.0	My sister is mexican-american too but she has natural blond hair and hazel-green eyes? My sister is beautiful with her natural blond hair and colored-eyes,\nbut she looks REALLY different from me.Yes,we got the same parents.We are both mexican-american,what could explain my sister's different physical features. Basic Mendelian genetics.  Mexico was invaded by Spaniards, many of whom had familial ties to the north, England, France, etc.  These Spaniards raped many native Mexican women, some actually had the respect to marry natives, and some American cowboys since then have added to the gene pool.  Therefore, there are recessive genes for blue eyes and blond hair in both of your parents.  Ask your parents or grandparents if they know of any Caucasians in your family tree.  I bet you'll be surprised.0	Is the ability to speak and write English an indication of intelligence? A member by the name of fsb2u2004 insinuated that this is the case. What about people who speak 6 other languages fluently (I know such people) - but they still happen to struggle with English - are they not intelligent? I don't think all English speaking people can be considered intelligent, and neither the other way around. It just means that maybe you were born in a geographical area. Nothing more. There are some studies that show that different languages require different sides of the brain to be spoken. If that is the case, the difficulties on learning a English can be only a temporary "out of practice" use of that side of the brain. It just takes some more time. The same with all the other languages.5	do you guys think this will have an effect on smackdown? smackdown is loosing all its members to ecw the newest member of ecw is lashley.He left smackdown because he was having problems with the creative team and the bookers as well and that is why davari,khali,eljah and sylvester leave.

If, when asked to recite the alphabet, one says "a" followed by "z" and then stops, that person has not multi-tasked because the task has not been completed regardless of sequencing issues.  Multi-tasking only occurs when the given task is executed to completion.  Either your example is flawed or the assumption of multi-tasking is flawed.\n\nIn computing, multi-tasking requires a minimum of 3 processes: two processes that share the assigned work and one that supervises the functional tasks to insure that they are performed in sequence (and sequencing does matter) and monitors for completion of tasks A and B.  These processes can be assigned to three different CPUs.  While the human brain does have multiple parts, I have not heard of cognition occuring separately in the parts.\n\nIs it possible to think two distinctly different thoughts simultaneously?  My inclination is to say no, the subject is merely jumping from one thought to another and back rapidly - not truly multi-tasking.  Can you cite the basis and origin(s) of the multi-tasking diagnosis?  Would very much like to follow up on this interesting line of thought.6	How do you cut a banana from the inside? I heard this was attempted before but I forgot the explaination. Best way is to use a needle and thread.  Push needle through the banana in a pattern forming a square.  At each corner feed the needle back through the same hole that it and the thread came throug.  When you get back to the start hold both ends of the cotton and gently pull the cotton out of the banana.  This neatly cuts the banana without mashing it (like the other idea).  If you do this 3 or 4 times you can peel the banana and eat it in ready made segments.\n\nI remeber the same book of magic tricks.7	Do you think you are photogenic?

I'm trying to get my name out there by starting w/ the free resoures first because I have know extra $ right now can you help me? thanks- AJ Owner of www.amyfalk.biz The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice "Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content.

You heard the hype and the spin. Hate the game and the rules but.......they are the rules. Women(back when they were ladies)were looked up to and held with a higher regard. that is why you stood when a lady entered, you held her chair, opened the door for her. She was the Ferrari to the men's Ford. You didn't just treat her with the commonality as you would a toaster or a vacuum. She was a prize to be won, not a commodity to be utilized. She was suppose to be more wise in relationships going for the things most important to the heart and the family. She WAS the anchor to the family. No man could run a successful household with out a very strong woman anchoring it. More was expected of women. Now all that is expected of them it to get in the bedroom, take off the clothes, shut up, and take a cab home, "I'll call you" so lose number. Girls today get dogged out because they no longer wanted to shoot for the 'A' because they wanted to be like the boys who no one expected to get pass a "C-".7	Paris Hilton..... irritating bane of our existence ., or most innovative star of our times?

We've seen others shrink (Pudge, Trot Nixon, Sammy Sosa) after testing came into effect, so this must be their normal body sizes.  But Jeter and Arod among others have not noticeably gotten smaller.  If you worked out with steroids but focused on strength AND flexibility without weight gain, could you do it?  Just trying to figure out if the entire steroids era should be ignored statistically.  Thanks. You have to understand that every guy you named has been a slugger since Little League...McGwire and Bonds were jacking out homeruns when they were skinny rookies.  Keep in mind, the main reason baseball players used steroids is not for increased power but for the increase in recovery from injuries so they can play more games.  Look at the list of guys you put up there who have "used": Bonds, McGwire and Sosa were all home run hitters but were getting older and had more nagging injuries.  Why do you think Barry can barely jog to first base these days now that he's not on the juice?  Pudge is a catcher, the most physically taxing position in baseball so his use for recovery purposes is understandable.\nARod and Jeter are still reasonably young so they can absorb the punishment.  Let's see how they do in 5 or 6 years.  Interestingly, how do you think Griffey Jr's homerun total would have been affected if he juiced?  The guy was always injured and steroids may have gotten him back on the field quicker.5	TONIGHT!!!!!  Who's gonna win? Univ. of Cincinnati or Rutgers?

Why would all this differant races want to come to American if they will be hated, and if a visa is all they need to get accepted, what is the big deal? Because they will not be hated. Not hated enough to make a difference in the better life they will make here. Not hated enough to make a monetary difference in the income increase they will probably receive. Ever heard the saying "Sticks and stones will break my bones but words can never hurt me!"\n\nActually I'm not sure where you heard that immigrants are hated. I find that strange, as a New Yorker.\n\nPerhaps if I lived in Texas I would feel the effects of immigrants from Mexico, but I doubt it. Even so, just cause Americans seem intolerant with their loud words and "hatred", they are pretty well behaved when it comes to violence.\n\nI bet a Chinese,Mexican or African Immigrant would have less of a chance of being injured in the United States by far, than in their home country. If they are white immigrants, they definitly will not have problems, except for maybe a couple of jokes at a bar.\n\nAmericans may be obnoxious and opiniated regarding immigration, but I think most people, like 99.9% of "haters" will not act on it. the others who do, would probably hurt anyone, regardless of race.\n\nAlso getting a Visa is a big deal, from what I hear.

I would like to read your answers to questions about the industry, no matter what part of the world your in.\nLove for music is something that is deep with in. Please tel me question you. Email me crystalsingers@yahoo.com.au Please take a chance on me. Everthing will be private if you wish. Well, there are two different topics here:\n\n1) The music creation / artistic part of making music\n2) The music business itself (i.e., lawyers, labels,\ncontracts, profits, royalties, paychecks, etc).\n\nWell, obviously, creating the music is the rewarding part emotionally.  You get to create something from your imagination and also something that reflects your personality and give it to public listening.  This is the part that is also the most fun portion.  It should not be tied down by business rules.  But, in many cases it is.\n\nThe music business is, as is all other money making industries, just a business solely interested in making money.  So, as long as the music is popular and it continues to make money, that artist is at the top.  If that stops, then the artist becomes a has-been.  If the artist was industry created (like so many artists of today), then that person becomes a nobody as fast as they became a somebody.  Today, the music business is almost solely focused on piracy without regard to anything else.  They are so entranced by this issue that they have forgotten that they really need to provide quality music to the listening public.\n\nSo, because of the piracy issue, the music of today is really not that great.  Much of today's music is primarily created in the producer's mind and by the producers... hiring people solely to fill the roles (just as as a film might hire an actor).  In the past, a group of musicians would get together and create music and then be discovered.  Today, it's just the opposite.  Producers create the music up front and then find someone with the look and a reasonably decent voice to fill the role.  Rarely is commercial pop music actually created by talented musicians.  It's now almost solely created by a producer who then hires musicians to play the music to what was already written (requiring only musical instrument skill, but little, if any, writing talent).\n\nThe contractual part of the music industry is where most new artists get bitten hard.  If you're undiscovered, then they rope you in to signing a horrible contract with small amount of pay and lots of concert work.  So, you get little in the way of pay, but you do a lot of work for them (that you are contractually obligated to provide).  So, if you ever get into the position of signing a record contract, be careful to read the verbiage exactly (and have a lawyer that you have hired go over it with you).  Don't blindly sign it simply because you want a record deal.8	How would i find my mother on line? she's in New York somewhere.

The Higher Education Act was instituted in 1965 for the benefit of low- and middle-income students pursuing higher education.  Yet some of the $70 billion allocated to this program have increasingly been diverted from their original purpose of expanding access for students, and cost increases have made it clear that America’s higher education system is not accountable enough for its consumers.  In the 109th Congress, Representative Michael McNulty voted alongside 198 others not to expand the provisions under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to reflect today’s standards of living. i think that the poeple thAt handles the money holds bak some for thenselfs. not all of it goes to the schools3	What is the average cost  of following a degree, MBA, MSC in India?

I asked him if he fantasizes about any other grl (to see if i could make myself feel a bit less guilty) and he said he doesnt. idk..but i think he lies does every guy fantasize about other grls. is it wrong to? You shouldn't feel guilty about fantasizing about other people. I do it all the time, and so does my boyfriend. I think it is okay to fantasize about others because it's only a fantasy and not something you would pursue in real life. It's normal.1	calling all ye math experts? The mum is 21 years older than the child.\n In 6 years from now the mum will be 5 times as old\n as the child.\n \nQuestion :\nWhere's the father? Let the child be 'x' years old right now.\nSo the mum must be x + 21 years of age.\nSo, After 6 years the mum will be x + 21 + 6 = x + 27\nyears old and the child will be (x + 6) years old\nat that time.\nSo from the given information we get,\n5*(x+6)=x+27\nTherefore,\n5*x+30=x+27\nTherefore,\n4*x=27-30\nTherefore\n4*x=-3\nTherefore\nx=-3/4\nBut -3/4 years = -3/4 * 12 months\ni.e. the child is -9 months right now.\nThis means the child is just getting conceived.\nHence the father of the child must be in bed with\nthe mum right now!5	Who was the first cyclist to break one minute for the 1km time trial (on the track)?  i dont know but i think it was at a track in mexico2	What kind of device or clothing could I use to protect my male reproductive area from overheating while using? a hot spa/jacuzzi.\n\nBackground information: fertility doctors recommend against overheating the testes. An example of overheating would be using a hot spa for more than 5 minutes. However, I used to enjoy using the spa quite a bit, but I want to be able to use it while protecting myself with some type of heat insulating device. Don't worry about it.  You might kill off sperm in your system during the spa time, but those balls are hardier than you think.  Sperm produced outside of the hot tub should be fine. \nI used a very hot hot tub every day for years at the Y--usually 110-112; also have 3 kids from that same time period.  If you do have very low sperm count, or the sperm fertility is very low, you might want to forgo hot tubs completely if you are trying to reproduce. \nIf you are not trying to reproduce, then enjoy the hot tub. We have too many experts out there telling us how we need to be living,  and we forget to just enjoy life.9	Would you vote for veteran as a president or a daddy's boy??  Apparently, everyone decided on the daddy's boy....... twice.1	whats your world view? theres A.catastrophism* and B.uniformitarianism*( or how ever you spell them lol)\nmines A, which mean you belive that the mian features of the world were created by catastrophies like earthquakes and volcano eruptions and floods etc.\nB, is that those thing were made in a slow process that took millions or billions of years. As a geologist I would have to combine both. There is ample evidence of catastrophic events such as meteor strikes that have caused major extinction events in the earth's history, yet I believe that plate tectonics is a cyclical process that has been the basis of most earth processes. I would argue that earthquakes, most floods, and most volcanic eruptions are part of the uniformitarianist view, since they take place on our planet on a daily (even hourly) basis and are driven by the slow process of plate tectonics. Some floods, such as the filling of the Mediterranean or the Black Sea were more likely catastrophic, but did very little to change the earth in the big picture. Some major volcanic events may have changed the earth's climate for a period of decades afterwards, but are still minor over geologic time. Only when large numbers of volcanoes were erupting together over long time periods did they have potential to change the planet, and this fits easily into uniformitarianism.   \n\nThere is growing evidence that climate change may be more catastrophic than previously believed. Past climate change appears to have been quite sudden at times. This may be due to the nature of feedback within climatic systems that causes several factors to react together to accelerate the overall effects. For example, melting icecaps could shut down or alter major ocean currents, which in turn would accelerate atmospheric circulation patterns that cause warming. Some of these past warming events may have happened quite suddenly, yet much of climatic change has been related to plate tectonic motion (Wilson Cycles) and to Milankovitch cycles in the Earth's orbit that are quite regular. Slow movement of tectonic plates does cause changes in oceanic and atmospheric patterns such as ocean currents and even the jet streams so many of the factors of change are quite slow and gradual, making uniformitarianism as valid as catastrophism and pretty much requiring acceptance of both.9	Does life begin at conception?  No it doesn't.\n\nLife began many million years ago when chemical processes happened to create DNA and the first rudimentary organisms. Life hasn't stopped since then. Conception is just a process of continuation. The individual cells that participate in conception are alive as well. The sperm is alive, as is the ovum.\n\nLife is not an isolated event like many people think it is. Life is a phenomenon that doesn't care whether we put arbitrary stop signs and say here is where it begins.\n\nA correct question to ask would be "Is the fertilized egg a complete person?" And the answer to that is also no. A fertilized egg is a zygote. It is not even an embryo. After the zygote has divided into more than one cell and it has attached to the female's uterus, it becomes an embryo. In case of humans, only after about 8 weeks when all major organs have developed, does the embryo attain the status of a fetus. At that point, you could say, yes it is a baby.2	i am allergic to cats adn am wondering if there is anything i can do to stop this problem? my sister has 3 cats and i always avoid going to her house because of that. she always invites me over and then when i do go i start sneezing and and i cant breath right.

There are all kinds:\n\n1/ Tax rebates - they kind of defer taxes for a certain period provided certain conditions are satisfied. These are usually given in areas that are under-served e.g. need to attract business and so forth. The developer gets a kind of deferment on the tax rate and pays a discounted rate. In some markets, the localities oferred rebates for new single-family housing. In Cleveland, for example, the county tried to gentrify some low-income areas by oferring rebates on new SFR construction.\n\n2/ Tax credits - very popular with multi-family properties where the developer is given an incentive to build a new apt complex and lease below market as low-income housing for a certain period. Once the period lapses (say 10 years), the developer can raise rents and lease at market rate. At which point, the developer gets a tax credit that is sometimes used "as cash" (i.e. syndication) to raise capital for new/other real estate projects the developer may have on the books. The loophole in the law allowing for syndication will probably be closed by Congress (if they have not done so already) since it creates a myriad of problems from the developer and county angles.\n\nThere are so many other kinds but these are the 2 that I have encountered on more than one occassion.4	How many megabites can my yahoo mail acct. accept?

I'm in surveying I and I was given a HW problem for Traversing.  There is no help in my book or notes... How do I compute the azimuth  error of closure on a closed traverse? It is really the angular error youare looking for.  From your first backsight, which should be a given azimuth, (if not just assume the first backsight is North) add the first angle to that and calculate the next azimuth or bearing, then from there, process each angle to come up with the next azimuth. When you come to the last(closing) angle, compute the last azimuth, which should be the same as your starting azimuth(or 180 degrees  from it). The diffference between your last azimuth and the starting azimuth is your angular error.\n\nI am a PLS in my state, so I guess I am an authority.4	why doesn't my tool bar appear?  right click just too the right of the word help at the top of the browser page then click on any toolbars you want to show3	what is another word for dialog?

I have been in IRAq and have missed the season but was able to catch the last two games. I am very shocked, where is their offense? Has it been like this all year>? They have no consistent offensive attack. The last game 8-2 was an embarrassment to the organization but mostly to the fans and city. Has Hitchcock lost the team? Then i read the coachs commments to each other which even pumps me up even more. Is there any chance for them to turn it around. COme on Flyers!! The biggest problem of the Flyers this year has been consistency.  With a healthy lineup intact and playing to their potential, they have shown themselves to be capable of beating any team in the league.  However, this has rarely been the case.  Injuries have devasted them.  Forsberg has missed a lot of time, along with Johnsson, Pitkanen, their leader Primeau just to name a few.  Even when their lineup was semi-back together, they still have failed to play the way they are capable most of the time.  One of the brighter points about the Flyers this year though has been the play of their rookies.  Mike Richards and Jeff Carter have played strong in their debut season.  Antero Niittymaki has been amazing.  Even R.J. Umberger, despite being clocked in game 1, has played very well.  Another thing that always seems to stick in my mind about this team is that, i hate to say it, they play stupid hockey.  Every game it seems they take dumb penalties on things that have been getting called all year.  They have not been able to adapt as well as some other teams to this "new nhl."\nAs far as the playoffs so far have gone, game 1 was actually an amazing game.  Robert Esche was flat-out phenomenal.  Despite a lackluster performance by most other players out there, he almost singlehandidly kept them in contention.  I wish they could have won the game if only for the way Esche played.  Even Forsberg, despite an awful beginning, bounced back and showed why he's the best player in the world.  As far as game 2, i really don't even know what to say.  They simply got blown out.  It didn't even look like they were trying.  Buffalo's a fast team, but they have to expect that and be ready to play.  Moving on now to the future in game 3.  This time, they're coming back to philly.  Sure, they didn't get the split up in Buffalo like they would have liked, but they can still bounce back, its just there's almost no room for error.  Plus, the readdition of Keith Primeau to the lineup could provide the team with the spark it needs to get over the hump.  All it takes is a win in game 3, and the flyers will be right back in it.  In game 1, if only Sami Kapanen didn't hit that post in overtime, imagine where this series would be now...8	gimme some sex possitionz u love and are different!!?

Leave it be for now and stay his friend. If he is with someone else, and ends up running between the two of you, you'll only end up hurt and may lose him as your friend. Bide your time, or if you really must, tell him - but don't act on it when hes with somebody else.2	is 110-56 low blood pressure?  As a paramedic, that looks good to me. You didn't mention your age or any health problems. If I were to see you in my ambulance, providing you didn't have any trauma, that is not a treatable blood pressure. Go to the American Heart Association web site. There is good info on blood pressure education. Also, don't hesitate to sit at one of those automated blood pressure machines at the pharmacy (Target, Walmart) and just get it checked. Most fire departmants welcome people to get their pressure checked for free. I took several people right to the hospital because I felt like they could stroke out any minute. Saved a life or two I'm sure.5	In your opinion, who are the 5 players "feared" most by the players themselves?

I know that he loves me but he just doesn't want to do it.  He doesn't have a stressful job or anything.  I do what i know to please him, cooking cleaning sewing his cloths, I complement him, I give him gifts I spend lots of time with him, but still nothing.

I'm Gaining  weight too fast. You can't live that long without food, let alone water. so you would die. Just remember to Decrease food intake, Increase activity/exercise and lots of water... When you starve your body of nutrition your body will start to slow your metabolism down to reserve and store nutrients for later. Then if you don't use that nutrients stored, it turns to fat. So keep moving... exercise increases metabolism, eating CERTAIN foods can increase your metabolism. FYI: Just 3% below average hydration/water in your body can cause your metabolism to slow down. Drink lots of water.  I hope this helps, remember dramatic change in diet can make your skin breakout, menestral cycle abnormal, and make your hair more brittle. Take care of yourself the rightway and you'll look healthier.6	can nothing be something?

I am tried of people from other countries telling us what is wrong with our great country. The need to fix their own countries, then we will talk. There is a reason we are a world power - politically, millitarily, finically, & socially . Even our entertainment is watched all over the world, we do not watch many foreign films - so why take their advice? Well, critique is important for any country. Say your make-up's fucked up and your worst enemy tells you, you get pissed because its her...but you fix the problem and then she can't say anything. So I think if it's good criticism, not like USA sucks, but a real problem...we aren't better than anyone else, we just have more luxuries. We're not perfect and knowing what our weaknesses are, allow us to better this country. So if it's ignorant, ignore it, but if this country can eventually better from it, then it wasn't just a waste of breath. If they choose to better our country instead of theirs its their loss and our gain.6	Hairstylist for 3yrs. I cannot seam to keep any clients, I offer free haircuts, with no luck, what to do?

I need 2 no y ur ankle swells when u sprain it for my hw!! Swelling occurs when ligaments are injured because the ligaments are intimately connected with the functioning of the joints. Ligaments hold our joints together, helping to maintain the structural integrity of the skeletal system. When a ligament is strained, the synovial membrane of the joint where the ligament is located is "told" by the brain to produce more fluid than is required for proper functioning. This increase in synovial fluid causes the joint to swell. This swelling is our body's way of sending us a strong and important message. The body is saying, "Don't move me too quickly or too vigorously, or I will send pain signals to remind you that I need to rest in order to heal."8	do you love me?  i love everyone in this world but only 1 person as my lover2	i have tried protein shakes and kreatin but it doesnt seem to what else can do? docotor says no working out till gain weight protein needs training to function well on the muscle, and creation works as a power enhancer that gives u higher performance in gym ...\n\nI tried both, and i gained 10 kilos after using them in 3 month.

Please also tell me the examples for each. thanks. :) Normally an Information Server is used within a company intranet to give out time, date, calender, etc information to the users on the network. Typically it is used to distribute files, programs, and information sent by one person to another person or to several people. You would use this in a company that needs to share out digital memos, calendered events, email between users in the company, etc. You could also use this type of server in an environment with dumb terminals or a client/server networking scheme. While a Web Server is primarily used to send information to people outside the company. It is used to set up the website, distribute the website, and hold all the website's resources, coding, and security. You would use this type of server if your company had a large website, or a medium sized website that you wanted to keep secure and distribute out over the internet. It can be done other ways though a Web Server is the preferred method.9	Do I have to be shown a warrent and told why I am being placed under arrest at the time of my arrest if I ask?

In most FPGAs, these programmable logic components (or logic blocks, in FPGA parlance) also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memories.2	What is the best remedy that is homemade for a sore throat?

Most of the people on this board are preteens and teens that have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to microprocessors.\n\nThe best processor available now is Intel's Core 2 Duo...period. This may change in time, however, as it stands right now, the Core 2 Duo is best. Anyone telling you otherwise is just an uniformed teeny bopper.\n\nPeople telling you that AMD processors run hot are beyond clueless. That USED to be the case years ago, way before the Athon 64. Until just recently (until Core Duo) AMD processors ran much COOLER than Intel processors, as excess heat was one of the reasons the Pentium line was scrapped. Now, in terms of heat generation, they're close to the same, with a slight edge going to AMD.\n\nIf you really want an AMD Turion system for your laptop, by all means get one, as they're not bad...just not quite as good at this time as Intel's offering. This may not remain the case though in the second half of 2007, when AMD updates its line.1	how do i calculate the number of 12inx12in blocks i would need to put in a 10ftx10ft  kennel as a floor?  change the feet into inches of the area of kennel then divide the area of blocks in inches square\n\n(10x12)"(10x12)"/144^"\n(120x120)^"/144^"\n14400/144\n=100 unit.\n\neasy..come on..4	i have CD player&writer in my pc,can i play dvds by just downloading a software or i have to have a dvd drive?  in order to play DVD's you need to have a DVD drive, as well as the software to play the movie.1	I need HELP with understanding logarithms.

When asked they explained that they had always been told what to draw.

Kegel exercises are the main way to increase vaginal tone.  Gently tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor as if you were trying to stop the flow of urine or a bowel movement.  Hold for 5-10 seconds, then release.  Repeat 5 times, three times a day at first, then slowly increase the number.  \n\nThese exercises will also help reduce swelling and reduce the risk of complications later on, like urinary dribbling and incontinence.2	so anybody answer about weight? im 150 pounds and i work out everyday im 5feet 6 inches and im 14 yrs old\nim i good to go or should i lose weight Following a regular exercise program and eating a healthy diet will naturally give you your personal ideal weight.

For your benefit, and information, I feel it wise to inform you that penis enlargement pills do not actually increase the literal size or length of your penis, but merely "improve" blood circulation and flow to the nether-region to give the erection a slightly larger, more "engorged" (and therefore, larger) in appearance.  So really, they should be called something other than "penis enlargement pills."  \n\nDepending on which brand of so-called "penis enlargement pills" you intend to try, you may be ingesting organic (natural) extracts, herbal substances, vitamins, flavors, fillers, dyes, waxes, binders, etc.  There has also been some evidence and documentation of these products being contaminated by a number of undesirable ingredients.  (For more information about this in general, see the Wiki article I've linked you to in my sources.)\n\nAs far as side-effects are concerned, depending on which ingredients are used in the "penis enlargement" pill you've chosen, you may experience many of the side-effects involved in taking stimulants and other medications which oxygenate the blood and improve circulation.  Specifically, some of those side effects may include:  upset stomach, nausea, anxiety, hallucinations, insomnia, headaches, loss of muscle function, increased blood pressure as well as rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and severe hypertension to name a few...  ***It should be noted that these side-effects are presumably possible in a normal, otherwise healthy subject.  These pills may actually exacerbate any negative symptoms or complaints accompanying previously existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure...\n\nPersonally, I believe "penis enlargement" pills are not a necessity for sexual performance or vitality.  Perhaps they have a "placebo-like" value to them, which helps improve the consumer's self-esteem, ego, and self-image which is definitely beneficial as far as boosting the individual's confidence in intimate situations, but they shouldn't ever be a requirement.  In my opinion, if you want to be in the ranks of male "sexual dynamos" and "great lovers," you should be more concerned about learning how to properly "USE" the equipment you were born with for the maximum benefit and pleasure of yourself, as well as those with whom you have sexual interactions, and less concerned about the physical "size" of your equipment.  It has been my experience that guys who are obsessed with increasing the size of their package think that increased size will compensate for poor technique and what I like to call, "operator error."  =)  \n\nPenile penetration isn't everything, however.  Learning to administer pleasure in other ways, (i.e., massage, or perhaps incorporating sexual aids and toys) may be a positive and healthy alternative to imaginary "penis enlargement."  You may discover that seeking alternative methods and means of giving and receiving pleasure is very sexually stimulating as well as sexually satisfying.  \n\nSo basically, in this girl's opinion, SIZE REALLY DOESN'T MATTER, as long as you know how to "work it" with what you've got!  \n\nCheers!8	what was the best invention of all time and y? thank you in advance to all replies Toilet paper.

What will be the biology explanation for it? I believe that the process of producing and laying an egg is consuming a lot of resources. Why would nature create such a process? It doesn’t seems to be reasonable Do you REALLY want to know the answer to this question?\n\nThe answer to why chickens lay eggs is in reproduction. Just as women have monthly cycles of discarded eggs, so do chickens. The eggs you eat are the bi-product of the reproduction cycle in the form of an unfertilized egg. That red spot you might see on occasion, that's a fertilized egg and was the beginning of a chick but plucked from the nest before it had a chance to mature. In most commercial hen houses where chickens are housed in small cages, there are no roosters.\n\nI don't think chickens lay eggs every day and that is why you would usually need more than one if you want eggs on a daily basis, but chickens do lay often.1	What kinds of fish is the best for earning a lot of money ?

First of all, the face is pixellated and contrasted to determine where the edges of the face and important features (eyes, nose) are located. \n\nNext, the recognition algorithm uses this information to proceed.  A simple algorithm would have the following steps.\n\n1.  Identify and scale distinguishing characteristics\nThese can be the roundness of the face, the position of the eyes, etc.  The roundness can be determined by the uniformity of curvature of the face's outline.  A higher roundness number would mean a rounder face.  The eye position can be the vertical distance from the chin to the pupil.\n\n2.  Map and label the numerical values\nA person's face may have a roundness of 2 (out of 10) and his eyes may be 8 inches above the tip of his chin.  The value (2,8) can be stored in memory with that person's name associated with it.\n\n3.  Determine the importance of each trait\nThis is the tricky part.  A person's face may match 'close enough' with several names in the database based on the measured traits.  Conversely, multiple people can also match a particular stored  data point.  For instance, two people with traits (2.1,8) and (2,8.1) can match the (2,8) data point stored earlier.  However, some traits are more important because they are more useful in distinguishing faces.  In order to determine how important each trait is, the computer must 'learn' through neural network logic.  After much trial and error (i.e. the 'learning' process which occurs as part of the development phase) the algorithm may determine that roundness is more important, and therefore the (2,8.1) person will be identified as being the true match.7	Does any one Like The suite Life of Zack and cody? 1.

We've been dating a few weeks. Things are starting to get a little physical, and while I'm not complaining, I don't want to have sex until I know that this is a relationship that's gonna last a while.

Does bundling paper and crushing milk cartons really make a difference or is that just a way of making people think they are helping? Recycling saves energy, landfill space and the planet.  It is necessary on many levels.  Some examples are:  Aluminum cans made from recycled metal only use 5% of the energy that's needed to make that same can from non-recycled metal.  Every ton of paper you recycle is 17 trees that didn't have to be cut down.  So if you look at the amount of stuff we recycle you can see that it really does make a difference.  Also, most of the materials we are currently collecting go back into making the things we buy.  If we didn't use recycled content, we would have less resources to use in manufacturing.5	What is this quarterback rating thing?

Sodium Hydroxide is the strongest type of principal chemical used in some chemical relaxers because it provides the most long lasting and dramatic effects. However, this same sodium hydroxide is found in drain cleaners which well demonstrates the strength of this chemical. It is what is used in products that are referred to as “lye” relaxers. The strength varies from a ph factor of 10 to 14. With higher ph, the faster the straightening solution will take hold, but the more potential the damage. \n\nGuanidine Hydroxide is the other common option of relaxer chemical used today. This is what is referred to as “no-lye” relaxers. This label can be misleading to some consumers. It does not imply that there aren't any strong chemicals used or that the chemicals used are somehow less potentially damaging. Some have mistakenly thought that with “no-lye” relaxers there are less steps and all the worry of chemical hair straightening is removed. Although this type of chemical hair relaxer can be less damaging than its counterpart, the hair and scalp should be in top condition before attempting treatment, and this type also requires special care when applied. \n\nAll relaxers require conditioning treatments before and after application. The decision to straighten the hair chemically requires much forethought and really a commitment to healthy haircare treatments over a long entire period of time.5	Is Ryan howard mvp Caliber? i think he si He's MVP caliber, but he loses votes with each game the Phillies move further and further back in the division.9	How do you check for harmful gases coming from the sewer in basement?

What is the essence of their rivalry? Is it purely technological? Or is that a tip of iceberg? Like, as we can see, Mustang costs/ed less than Corvette, so, is it a manifestation of fight beteween more rich and less rich America? Otherwise they should not be even compared - two different price-classes. It´s like comparing Chrysler Sebring with Cadillac STS. No offence, Mustang fans (I personally like Mustangs) There is nothing to compare.  For more than 50 years, Corvette has been America's premiere sports car, while Mustang was just a styling exercise on a Ford Falcon chasis.4	How to use the if statement in HTML without using any external script like javascript or css?

Yes, there are exercises you can do.  You have a muscles on the chest wall behind your breasts that you can flex if you take something that has a spring action in the middle, maybe a ball would work and put your palms on it and hold it at chest level and press on it using the muscles in your chest to apply the pressure, not the muscles in your arms.  Flexing this muscles in your chest will firm up and help accentuate a nice breast line. Try different exercise to work those muscles.   The breast has a working milk producing organ protected by fat.  And if you ever have a child and breast feed; the breast feeding will actually tighten up your uterus. You will feel it tightening as you are breast feeding your baby.5	FF: Who to start, that is the Question? So Brady lost me my game last week with the 4 pick outing. I have Garard as my 2nd option.

I would still like to have a beautiful wedding. We live in a small town, so I am not worried about paying for the church or pastor. But, decorations and the reception are going to be expensive. \n\nWhat can I use to decorate/ eat that is nice, but inexpensive? My cousin just had an average wedding and it was over $10,000! I am looking to spend about $2,000 for all of it. Any ideas would be great. Thanks! I spent roughly $1,000 for my wedding - and we had enough money to spent a lot more, but I don't see the need!\n\nWe got married in our backyard (the minister came to perform the ceremony) as we lived on a lake and the lake was the background for the pictures.  My brother was in college to be a professional photographer, so he took the photos.  I also gave all of the guests little disposable cameras (not digital back then), but you can ask all of them to bring their own and then email you all of the photos - the candid ones are usually the best anyway!  If you need more professional photos, perhaps you can make a trade with a photographer for something they need!  \n\nAs for food, it was a summer wedding and I didn't want to provide "hot" food or anything heavy. I wanted everyone to enjoy themselves, so I put in the invitations that the reception was going to be at the house and that we were going to have fun afterwards - so bring summer clothing to change into!  While everyone was changing, I had a local deli cater finger sandwiches, fruit salad, various fruits and vegetables with dips, chips, hot dogs for the kids, etc.  Everyone loved it and thought it was much more relaxing and enjoyable than a stuffy big wedding! \n\nFor music I asked a few friends to bring their favorite CDs and we just had a nice stereo set up with speakers outside.  We did not have dancing, but instead we all went swimming and waterskiing.  \n\nFor flowers, I went to a local flower grower and bought them at cost - and didn't have many, but had a lot of green plants instead that made it more of a tropical feel - and then those could be kept (still have some!). \n\nI'm sure that whatever you do will be nice - it's a special occasion no matter what you serve or how you decorate.  But just remember that it is all over in one day, so if you can cut costs without causing too many problems, go for it! The number one reason people don't like going to weddings is not because they don't want to celebrate, but because they're normally too formal and not relaxing.  Make it comfortable and everything will fall into place!\n\nGood luck and congratulations!9	Who was the first Black Lt Gov of the St of IL?

He can suddenly decide to do something without thinking of it's  outcome. He is the type of guy with an inside energizer, so if you fall in  love with this type of guy be "patient", even if you have to follow him a  bit. His creative mind could create fantastic idea any time. If you do not  understand or can not follow him, you won't be with him for long. \n\nA  man in this Zodiac will less likely to have a pale skin, and if he has a scar, it would be on his face or on his head. He moves very fast and very energetic, and he has a very self confident in himself. He is not the type to sit down and feel sorry or regret anything for long, especially with "Love". He loves justice. He dares to show his opinion or even argue about certain subject even he knows it might bring him problems. A straight forward type of guy. He hardly lies except if he think it is  necessary and he is not a good liar anyway. He will not lie to you about  serious matter, but if he lie he will lie only a small little thing. He is  gifted with the ability to be a very social person. He could talk even about  subject that he has no knowledge of. He interests only at the present time  and look at the world positively. Many times he feels hurt because of  reality, but he will not run away and he will overcome that  difficulty. \n\nEven he is a high and self confident type and center his own   thought as a main focus, but at the same time he is a kind, cute and polite guy. He certainly is not a mean person. He likes to help people who are in troubles even he is not asked to. He is the type who feels sorry if you remember bad things he said to you that he had already forgotten,but you did not. Belief him that he is very sorry and give him another chance. Once he decides to do something, he will put all his mind and energy in it either in his "Work", or "Love". He is the type who gamble anything in the casino, so do not even take him there. He does not like pessimistic, low energy, and depress person, especially no brain. Strangely he like to overpowered this type of people to assure that he is more superior. \n\nHe like to be the first person to do something. You can see   sparkling in his eyes, once he meet a new target or new lover. Once he is in love, he will act as if he never has love like this before. This minute he could be real sugar sweet, and later he could also be an icy cold, but do not blame him for that will only chase him away. He could fall in love again with another girl and act again like he never has this kind of love before.He could really love someone, but not a heart broken type for he  thinks love is "excitement" and "Love goes on". If you date this kind of guy, do not or avoid showing your face to him with face pack, face mask, always be presentable, nice and cute. If he is quiet not because he is shy, but he is only quietly thinking. If you have a chance to ask his  X-girlfriend, she will tell you that he is not a shy or quiet type. If he is  really and truly in love with you, he will never lie to you at all. How do  you know if he loves you, bet on your faith! Love him and treat him steadily and do not try to find anything to argue with him, he will be with you for sure. \n\nIf you are his lover or girlfriend and need to tell him something,  go and say it out loud and straight forward because he hate long boring  story. He hate to play games, chasing for love or being chased, so let him  call you first. He likes a confident woman who also a good follower. If he gets mad at you, let him be for only a short time he will be normal again. You have to like and be able to get along with his friends, but he does not  have to do so with all your friends. \n\nDon't ever think you could make  him jealo7	What do you think is the best "romantic" couple movie?

This is my second speeding ticket since I started driving 10 years ago. I got the first ticket in 2001, but the officer didn't show up to the court, so it got thrown out. Can I still tell this judge  for the second ticket that I have a clean record (even though I got a ticket in 2001)?  Also, I am appeling this because the first time I went to the court, I pledded guilty, instead gulity with reason.  How should I plea this time?  I have already paid $100 as a bail. I don't mind paying this ticket, but i don't want any points on my driving records for insurance purpose. What should I do? Go to court and tell them you had a good driving record for about ten years. Maybe they will charge you with unsafe operation of a vehicle which is a higher fine but no points on your license. Whatever you do make sure you go to court and fight your ticket...they might be willing to drop it if you present a good case.3	How can I get a scholarship to Masters or PhD degree in Canada? I'm brazilian and have just got my Bachelor degree in Information Technology Systems. There is nothing in Canada for foreigners. Be more ambitious and aim for America. Canadians do not recognize foreign credentials. I knew this lady whose husband was doing his gradauate work back in China or Hong Kong, he emigrated to Canada with his family, Canadians pushed him back to being a second-year undergraduate. So please, for your sake, and your children sake avoid Canada at all costs. The Canadian government is getting sued for lying to immigrants. Trust me, if you graduate from a Canadian university you won't find a job because you lack "Canadian work experience". There's this story of this guy who wanted to find a job at a fast-food restaurant and they asked him,"Do you have a university degree." Trust me, there is more opportunity in America and your degree will have more meaning internationally. Besides, Canada is one of the countries on the world where PH.Ds drive cabs. AIM FOR AMERICA.Don't heed my advice at your risk.\n  I know.I have experienced both.\n   By the way, OSAP only applies to Canadian citizens or permanent residents.0	Why do people say "God is a jealous God" as if it's a good thing?

How does the nebular hypothesis for our solar system formation account for the presence of several moons around the outer solar system planets?  Does it also explain why these moons are so different from each other? You can think of the formation of the gas giants as mini-nebular events like the one the formed the larger solar system.  Your instructor is fishing for you to compare the gas giant systems to mini solar systems. He/she is also asking you to evaluate  differentiation between the smaller orbital radius moons and the larger orbital radius moons (more lighter elements further away from the central mass, because the nebula was cooler out there).  I think this is a weak argument, but it has some ammo if you look closely at the Galilean satellites. Ultimately,  the radial temperature profile  in the proto-Jupiter nebula is not necessarily the biggest factor in differentiation, however probably played some role.1	What is a stiunk?  the slang way of writing "stink"7	Aisleyne and susie are up for nomination this week, who do you want to go in the new house next door?

I'm an amateur photographer... right now it's a hobby, but I've developed such an immense interest, I'm looking to make it my career. I'm particularly interested in pet photography, but I want to get a feel for most, if not all, types of photography (wedding, portaits, nature, sports, etc.) before making a decision.\n\nI'm on a tight budget, so ideally, I'd like to find a studio that offers paid training so I can learn and still get paid for my work. I've contacted several Sears Portrait Studios with no response... any other suggestions or ideas for studios with paid training or individual photographers who would be willing to take on an assistant in the Central Florida area? Also, any advice in general? I've read up on SLR techniques, filters, lenses, lighting and pretty much any other basics I could find, but am pretty clueless right now about the business side of it (my goal is to start my own business). If you are interested in learning studio photography, Sears is a good place. I have worked at a Sears Portrait Studio in PA for almost 2 years now and have learned a lot about studio photography. The training is good on the whole. However, they do not allow animals in the photos so you will not get any experience for your main interest. You will get a lot of experience with children.5	What exactly are pressureless tennis balls?  Pressureless tennis balls have solid, rubber cores, in contrast to air-filled tennis balls.

A game like this would be great for my ministry!\n\nEducators:  Wouldn't it be great if someone would create a program for any subject you wanted students to learn that would do the question/answer theme they have going on here to capture kid's attention?\n\nDon't you think that seems to be the prevailing "hook"?  Today's youth are so pro-game that they would participate more under this setting? \n\nIf I am ignorant of these programs and they are out there, please let me know. You can set up an online forum on any topic you want easily enough.  You could just declare that the rules are you can only discuss the particular topic, and only in question and answer format.  If you're using it for a particular group (i.e. your class), you could just keep track of points on a whiteboard or such.  It probably won't be quite as addicting as Answers, though, because part of what's so great about Answers is only can discuss whatever topic you're interested in.  If you're trying to get kids interested in something their not, the Q and A format might be more engaging that straight lecture, but they won't find it as much fun as posting silly questions and getting silly answers.4	what is pocket pc?  a Pocket PC is a consumer electronics device small enough to fit *at least* your hand and maybe your shirt pocket or pants rear pockets, which allows you run common *adapted* pc applications with an interface very similar to popular windows PC.5	Should my eyes still be red?

The salt and Sun are pretty hard on the peepers.

What form this radiation takes depends on the temperature of the object - the sun is hot and emits visible light, the earth is cooler and emits heat.  The heat that is emitted from earth would be radiated out into the space if it wasn't for the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.  They absorb the heat, and emit it later, so that the heat stays in our atmosphere, where we can benefit from it.\n\nGreenhouse gasses are not harmful to the earth.  Examples of greenhouse gasses are water vapor and carbon dioxide, and they keep up the temperature of earth.  With greenhouse gasses, the average temperature on earth is 15 degrees Celsius above zero (60 degrees Farenheit above zero).  If there were no greenhouse gasses, the average temperature would be 18 degrees Celsius below zero (zero degrees Farenheit).  Quite a difference!\n\nWhen people speak of greenhouse gasses being harmful to the earth, they (most likely) mean that an increase of greenhouse gasses could be harmful, because that would probably mean increasing temperatures, which could lead to a  change in the climate.2	How do you get over the fear of needles? i.e. in a doctor's or dentist's office.?

In 1990, the House voted to reprimand Frank when it was revealed that Steve Gobie, a male prostitute that Rep. Frank had befriended after hiring him through a personal advertisement, claimed to have conducted a prostitution ring from Frank's apartment when he was not at home. Frank had dismissed Gobie earlier that year, and reported the incident to the House Ethics Committee, after learning of Gobie's activities.\nThe Boston Globe, among others, called on Frank to resign, but he refused. The House Ethics Committee recommended Frank be reprimanded because he "reflected discredit upon the House" by using his congressional office to fix 33 of Gobie's parking tickets. \nAnd why is this and Gerry Studds, McGreevy and other liberals highly worshipped? Take a look at this:\n\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\n \nFound this list at Human Events Online\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\n\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.9	What occurred on this day in political history?

Natural means something that exists in nature... homosexuality is naturally occuring, therefore it is natural.  Homosexuality is frequently seen among other primate species, not to mention that it has always been a part of human culture (whether openly or not).  What do you mean by not "natural?"  It happens in nature, therefore it can't be not natural.  I just don't get that argument.  \n\nI do think that same sex marriages should be legal, I don't think that there's a substantive difference between "unions" and "marriage"--it's not all in the name, there's nothing in the name but pointless bigotry, and haven't we already been through "separate but equal"?  And I don't get how legalizing same sex marriage would be the end of society.  Nobody has yet explained that to me, except to say that in Norway they have legalized gay marriage and more Norwegian kids are now born out of wedlock.  What the connection is there, I'm not sure, and why it's bad for kids to be born out of wedlock, I'm not sure either, as long as they have a loving home.2	How do I get rid of bad breath?  1. brush after every meal 2. rinse& floss after brushing 3. don't eat foods with offensive odors 4. get tongue scrapper 5. see a dentist often your bad breathe may be due to gum desease also get any rotten teeth pulled!9	The Bible says to comfort the feeble minded.

Additionally, the ground in the south was far more profitable for farming than for mining.\n\nVast northern coal and iron mines interconnected through expansive and inexpensive water ways .... \n\nMake sense ?  In the south, because of the rich soil and longer growing season, it was simply more profitable to put plants in the ground rather than on top of them -- sort of a pun there\n\n;-)2	whats a ob/gyn?? my doc told me to go see one because my cycle isnt regular An OB/GYN is a doctor specializing in preganancy and women's reproductive health.

I think it would be more peacefull As an Australian I have to correct a couple of you. We are not yet a republic, however we are not ruled by England. \nIf you knew anything about history you would know we were in both the 1st and 2nd world wars. We were nearly invaded by Japan during the 2nd.\nWe have troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor,West Papua, Bougainville, The Solomon Islands and are also having problems with Indonesia.\nApart from that, we live in a fairly peaceful environment. We have mistreated the native Australians, as all white settlements have in their countries and that is an issue that needs addressing badly.\nAs for ruling the world, I would say the present government is equipped for that. I believe we would really give it a go mate. LOL5	I have a baseball signed by 12 members of S.F.Giants including Willie Mays-Bobby Bonds? Mike McCormick Gaylord Perry and others anybody know what year they won the world series and what value this ball might have? A ball signed by Willie Mays alone will run around $250-$300 depending on the quality.  A ball signed by Bobby Bonds alone will run around $200, again varying by quality.\n\nA ball signed by both, and then more will be worth much more.  Especially if it has any established providence (You can authenticate the signatures and any good, real stories behind it).\n\nAs for being a WS ball, it is not one.  The four players you named only played together for 2.5 seasons, 1968 (Bond's rookie season) - July 1970 (when McCormick was traded).  Depending on other players on the ball, you may be able to narrow it down to the exact season.  They did not make the pennant in any of those seasons.  If you want to cross-check some other names, go to http://www.baseball-reference.com and go to the SFG page and look at those years for the rosters.\n\nHowever, the ball still has some classic HOF worthy signatures, and if authentic, could be worth some.  Value for an item like that is only what someone is willing to pay for it at the moment you want to sell it, and a reliable collectables shop should be able to get you a relatively good value, and help you get it sold if you want that.4	Maya Or 3Ds Max? Which one is better? I was working with 3Ds MAX for about 3 years.but I want to go to learn Maya.I think it is more powerful than 3Ds Max!\nBut I was always afraid about learning maya!\nI just want to know is it wasting the time for learnig maya or not?can I learn maya or not? Maya. As a former 3DS Max person myself, I found the transition easy. I mean there are hot keys, icon placement, and all that to learn. But it's not really that tough if you have experience with another 3D program, especially Max. I would have to say for ease of use, Max is better. It just seems more user friendly. The biggest problem is that you need a lot of plugins to do all the cool stuff, at least I did. Maya has most of the cool stuff already in the program, but it is harder to work with. It's not really much harder, just a slightly steeper learning curve. In the end, I would say it is good to know both if you plan to have a job in the field of 3D modeling or animation. Makes your resume look a lot better.0	What do you have to be thankful to God for? If His grace is all you have, that is enough to rejoice and praise Him!

Please help me!!! if you really WANT THIS BAD then your gonna have to WORK HARD FOR IT.  not just think "oh if i skip this meal then i can have a chocolate cake for dessert".  or if your gonna end up giving up why even try to lose weight?  first of all you need to watch what ur eating. no more snacking on all that unhealthy stuff. eat an apple if your hungry. next you need to start excercising.  taking a jog every day will help. enrolling in a hot yoga class could help too.  hot yoga is when you do yoga in a very hot room and you lose weight much faster.8	help dont know what to do? Ok this is what happened, my ex boyfriend left me in may he just went back to wv where he is from without even telling me and left a note...i was so upset and he only called me like once in a couple months, i was friends with some of his friends so I would always talk to his friend brian and he totally helped me through everything and was there for me and gave me advice and i did the same for him cause his x had recently left him for anohter guy. So in july i went to wv to get sum stuff back from my x & i went there to talk to him cause he we had never reallly talked after he left and i needed closure. while i was there i hung out with his friend Brian who helped me though everything and we ended up liking eachother (i live in ny) so since july me and brian talked everyday we both liked eachother and i went to visit him in october, everything was good and we had fun we even talked about me moving there, but he was friends with my xboyfriend for years, so wheni cam bak my x told brian If you really like the guy, and feel you a had a connection worth taking further, then you need to go there and talk to him in person - these types of conversations are never well suited to phone-calls or emails.\n\nKeep in mind that a three-way deal such as this can be tricky at times, and Brian probably feels caught in the middle - possibly even feels a little guilty for getting so close to his best mates ex. Just don't feel like it is something wrong with you - these are never easy situations. \n\nThe only thing you can do is talk to him face to face - if your friendship is worth anything to him, he'll open up and talk top you about how he is feeling. If he doesn't then simply chalk it up to experience and move forward.\n\nJust don't let this stop you from being true to yourself or allow it to close over your heart - then you really have lost something precious.\n\n*EDIT* - scandalous my butt! That's just worrying about what other people think - the one thing which usually does more harm than good.

Most home appliances don't give off enough of an EMF to affect us, at least so far as any studies have been able to determine.  Higher energy appliances like microwaves were once shielded rather badly, resulting in the warning in all the instruction manuals not to stand close to a running microwave if you have a pacemaker or internal defibrillator, because the stray EM could cause it to malfunction (I believe they've solved the shielding problem in modern models, but the warning's still there, just in case)  Just in case, I'd sit back a ways from the TV... luckily, the new LCD computer monitors put out considerably less EM (almost none, really)  These days, there are more hazards from the incidental (or intended) output other than stray EM -- tanning beds put out UV light that can damage skin over the long term or cause blindness if you don't wear the goggles properly, copy machines and faxes create ozone which can damage the lining of the lungs, etc.4	Can anyone expand PDA and tell about it?  Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\n\nThe term "personal digital assistant" was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\n\nPDAs are some times refered to as "Palms" or "Palm Pilot" after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc. This usage is a case of genericized trademark, similar to refering to a tissue as a "Kleenex"; or a bandage as a "Band-Aid".\n\nThe currently major PDA operating systems are:\n\nPalm OS - owned by Palm, Inc. \nWindows Mobile (Pocket PC), (based on the Windows CE kernel) - owned by Microsoft \nBlackBerry - owned by Research In Motion \nMany operating systems based on the Linux kernel - free (not owned by any company) These include: \nGPE - Based on GTK+/X11 \nOPIE/Qtopia - based on Qt/E Qtopia is developed by Trolltech, OPIE is a fork of Qtopia developed by volunteers \nSymbian OS (formerly EPOC) owned by Ericsson, Panasonic, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson \nMany PDAs run using a variation of the ARM architecture (usually denoted by the Intel XScale trademark). This encompasses a class of RISC microprocessors that are widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular 1970s/1980s CPU, the MOS Technology 6502.\n\nAccording to a Gartner market study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2005, compared to Q3 2004, with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):\n\nPalm OS for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other licensees- 14.9% (declining) \nWindows Mobile for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's Pocket PC specifications - 49.2% (increasing) \nBlackBerry OS for BlackBerry PDA (produced by Research In Motion) - 25.0% (increasing) \nSymbian OS - 5.8% (increasing) \n\nPopular PDAs\n \nPalm IIIxe PDAPsion \nApple Computer Newton \nBlackBerry \nhp iPAQ Pocket PC (Originally Compaq iPAQ until HP merged in 2002) \nPalm Pilot, Tungsten, LifeDrive, Treo and Zire \nSharp Wizard and Zaurus \nSony CLIÉ \nTapwave Zodiac \nAlphaSmart Dana \nDell Axim \nGMate Yopy \nFujitsu Siemens Loox 720 \nList of PalmOS Devices \nAbacus_PDA_Watch \n\nVarious operating systems based on the Linux kernel for various special designed PDAs (many other supported) - 0.7% (stable) \nOther - 4.4% (stable) \nThe reason usually cited for the resumption in PDA market growth (after market declines in 2002 - 2004) is the growing interest in PDAs offering wireless email capabilities (such as BlackBerries), and PDAs with built-in GPS capabilities for navigation. Smartphones — mobile phones with PDA-like abilities will likely curtail PDA growth in the near future, as smartphones are becoming very popular.1	do fishes sleep ?

Just wondering what can happen to you if you take Prozac (Fluoxetine) with other 'non-prescription' drugs i.e: ecstacy, speed, marijuana?\nWhat effect can this have on the body? Can it kill you or cause major problems? If only illegal drugs came in packets with instructions on the outside. We'd all know exactly what the drug would do, how much is too much and what other drugs are to be avoided at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately they don't. And while it's relatively easy to find out about the various effects of illegal drugs it's less easy to find out about safe amounts or dangerous combinations.\n\nMixing drugs isn't a good idea. It makes the effects unpredictable and the risks harder to define.2	What is Pleurosis?

Peace.\nEND of Edit\n  \nEDIT to Ku Lok´s answer:\n \nAt first I agreed with what Ku Lok said, but didn´t quite grasp how that would help define racism. Since he makes such an important point and (for me) takes a new approach to racism, but doesn´t make it clear, I´ve decided to add this edit to underscore his observations (which would easily fit as one of my "lose thoughts" below.\n \nIf a white (or non minority) does an act that may be construed as racism, someone might take advantage of that and play the race card. Others that go along, believing it to be racists without getting to all the facts correctly are themselves being racists. To use one of his examples, if he takes a managemant decision to promote a white person or fire a black on, it could be because of racism or not. To suppose it is, is a racist interpretation of the fact: "he´s white, therefore that decision was probably because he´s racist" or "he wouldn´t have fired Thompson if he were white". How can you possibly know that? How manny people even bother looking for the whole facts before making up there minds?\n \nPS: I don´t get the anger towards Airforce1989´s answer and it seemed that the bashing was uncalled for. The question should stand on its own and people don´t have any obligation other than try to give an honest answer to the question that was posted, which she did. At most, you could only expect that the answerer take the forum into account, anything other than that is completely optional. IMHO\n \nEND of EDIT\n------------------------------------------\n \nThis is such a complicated issue. Before I posted the answer I wrote, I read some of the others and found most questions focus on negative racism but almost completely disregard positive racism. Although it doesn´t seem as bad, you must remember that the negative only exists because od the positive.\n\nHere are some lose thoughts on this subject:\n1) Any kind of pre-evaluation based solely on racial characteristics. \nFor example: "Jose is Mexican so he must be illegal (or lazy)" and "Thompson is black so he´s likely to do drugs" are obviuos cases of racism. But, "This Thompson is really amazing, having become a Harvard lawyer being black and all" and "It´s really nice to see how Jose is good in math, since you´d might expect that he didn´t have very good schools down in Mexico" are also very racists because you automatically suppose they weren´t rich spoiled kids from Belair or something.\n \n2) Other obvious are "he´s black so must be good in basketball" or "ask her the answer because she´s Korean".\n \n3) Sometimes it´s not verbalised but can show as a pattern. I have a jewish friend who would alway speak positively of any other jew. If we were talking about the business´s managers, he would trash most of them, except the really good ones and the jewish ones. If we were talking about the sexy film stars, he would always praise the jewish a little higher. It bacame annoying once you got on to it. I think that is racism.\n \n4) Unequal employment opportunities are also obvious.\n \n5) A fine line: I´m white and the only black female actresses I feel sexually atracted to are Hale Barry and Tandy Newton (arguably "whitenned" to fit Hollywood´s standards). Is that racism? I think so. Lets put it another way. Would I ever treat two female co-workers (one white and one black) differently? No. Would I be equally likely to befriend them? I believe so. Would I feel equally sexually atracted to the black one (given she was as atractive)? So far, I have never even felt that attraction. Is that racism? I´m sure it8	how soon is too soon to get married? my boyfriend and i have been going out for two months and he is dropping hints about starting a family (5 kids and two dogs!!) and about getting married. hes got the wedding and everything planned out down to the caterer.   my heart is saying yes to everything because i believe he is my soul mate but the logical part of my brain is saying hes only doing it because he scared of going through another tough breakup (previous relationship)......I NEED HELP!!!

Which in turn must be made up of constituent particle. Therefore Every resultant particle is a constituent particle on it's own. Therefore if we stop subdivision of matter doesnt it mean that the so called smallest particle is not made up of anything else?And if it's so,doesnt it mean that it cant exist without a subparticle??And this means that stopping subdivision of particle means simply wiping out it's existence...Umm Am i right?(I want an xplanation for ur answer by the way Not yes or no) There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

She received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father. She became involved in a students' revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.\n\nHer early researches, together with her husband, were often performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a livelihood. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant researches and analyses which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of Marie's birth, and radium. Mme. Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.\n\nMme. Curie throughout her life actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she personally devoted herself to this remedial work. She retained her enthusiasm for science throughout her life and did much to establish a radioactivity laboratory in her native city - in 1929 President Hoover of the United States presented her with a gift of $ 50,000, donated by American friends of science, to purchase radium for use in the laboratory in Warsaw.\n\nMme. Curie, quiet, dignified and unassuming, was held in high esteem and admiration by scientists throughout the world. She was a member of the Conseil du Physique Solvay from 1911 until her death and since 1922 she had been a member of the Committee of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations. Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of Recherches sur les Substances Radioactives (1904), L'Isotopie et les Éléments Isotopes and the classic Traité' de Radioactivité (1910).\n\nThe importance of Mme. Curie's work is reflected in the numerous awards bestowed on her. She received many honorary science, medicine and law degrees and honorary memberships of learned societies throughout the world. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. She also received, jointly with her husband, the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and, in 1921, President Harding of the United States, on behalf of the women of America, presented her with one gram of radium in recognition of her service to science.\n\nFor further details, cf. Biography of Pierre Curie. Mme. Curie died in Savoy, France, after a short illness, on July 4, 1934.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901-1921, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1967 \n\nThis autobiography/biography was first published in the book series Les Prix Nobel.

Ever looked at spilled oil on asphalt? It is so cool looking, just wondering if there was an explanation for this. White light separates into different colours when it goes from air into oil, because red light is  refracted by a lesser angle than blue light. The same happens when light goes again out of the oil into the air.\n\nSpilt oil spreads out in multiple layers only a few molecules thick. When light falls upon it, part of it will be deflected on the top of the oil, directly into your eye. But a large part of the light will go into the oil, scatter back on one of the deeper layers and out again. This part will be spread out and produce a rainbow. \n\nNormally this effect is very tiny and you don't notice it for instance with spilt water where there are no layers. But with oil the effect is enhanced because the light rays can follow multiple paths inside the oil, scattering several times up and down on different layers, before coming out in the air again.8	I am looking for a web site that can help get a divorce for my fiance but he is disabled and needs help.?

When I ejaculate (after masturbating), the semen does not come out in powerful bursts. Instead, it kind of rolls out the end slowly and stays there. Is this normal, or do I need to talk to my doctor? From my hubby's database:\n\n\nOf all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity — not to mention the force of ejaculation — vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way. \nJust like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.\nIf you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance — but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).\n\n\nConsistency of semen isn't very consistent; you've probably noticed that the thickness of your ejaculate can vary from day to day. This is because the quality of the fluid is very susceptible to a number of factors. Diet, exercise and frequency of sex can all dictate how thick or watery your emissions are, as can the tightness of the clothes that you wear (tight clothing will increase body temperature and can thus impact sperm motility. \n\nFor men of normal fertility, sperm creation is a constant, ongoing process. Millions of sperm cells are created each day in the testes; they mature in one to 3 months, after which they're ready to be ejaculated. So, since there are always sperm cells being made, there is a lot of overlap between your "loads." Once one has been released, another should not be far behind.\nActual semen quantity differs among individuals and can also change for the same individual during different times of his life. Genetics plays an important part in how much a male will ejaculate. Most males ejaculate about one teaspoon of semen. Some medications may affect the amount of semen produced. And you will notice that the longer you take between orgasms the larger the quantity of semen you will ejaculate. (You've probably noticed that if you masturbate more than once a day that the second, third or fourth time you achieve orgasm you release smaller and smaller quanitities of semen. Wait overnight and see how much more your body made while you were asleep.) Additionally, the more aroused you get and the longer you take to ejaculate, the more semen your body will produce. Foreplay — touching yourself in special ways in special places — will sometimes stimulate the body to produce more semen, since the body's reproductive glands (such as the prostate) work harder when you're aroused.\nSemen appearance and texture can change naturally over the course of months, days, or even from one ejaculation to another, due to a variety of factors inculding diet.\nSemen from a mature male is usually a milky or pearly-white color. It is not uncommon to see a yellowish tint to the semen if you've abstained from ejaculation for a while. Semen colored with red streaks may signify blood. If you occasionally see a bit of blood it's not necessarily a cause for alarm, but if you see a lot of it, or if it persists, the condition should be brought to the attention of your physician. The same goes any other drastic color changes, which may indicate infection. \nA lot of factors go into the appearance and consistency of semen, including diet, ejaculation frequency, etc., so changing any of these can alter the way your semen looks. Also, it's easy to think that semen is simply sperm cells in water, but it's a much more complex substance than that. So it may have been the absence or presence of something other than actual sperm cells — such as sugars or proteins — that caused your semen to look different before.\nA nocturnal ejaculation may have more prostatic fluid in it (which is whiter and thicker), while a da1	Is one half odd or even?

You need minimum \n1. mRNA that acts as a template\n2. Ribosomes to catalyze the reaction\n3. Transfer RNAs carrying amino acids. The amino acids are the building blocks of the protein chain and the tRNA is needed so that the system knows which amino acid to use.\n But also GTP to provide the energy for the elongation of the chain, elongation factors, etc.3	if it's 0 dgrees today and its twice as cold tomorrow.

Some of our states are bigger - and more populous - than some European countries. They have a lot more autonomy than shires and counties in the UK. They have different speed limits, different ages at which people can buy tobacco or alcohol, different ages at which people can drive automobiles. The death penalty is another example.9	Can I get a job with fake green card and social security number?  The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n"Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea9	is it possible to create/start your own country under UK law?  9	Legal department on a Navy base does have experience with child support issues? i have had Dna results, and so i have the proof right, \nif i contact them, and explain that i have had DNA results\nand that legal papers need to be served to a service member, can they help with that, and can i fax it as im over in the uk.

I have a research paper due tomorrow by 3:00 and i didnt even start it yet... my question is religion in a public school. I was wondering if you as people in the world think the kids should be able to talk about their religioin openly. also that teachers should be able to bring it up without waiting for the students to talk about it. me as a christian(Assembly of God) and a freshmen in school i think that as students still learning religion should be an open topic. I'm not so sure that I will agree with you on the issue! you know as for everything maturity is the key, when we are young you go to church because our parents take us there, we don't choose our religion we follow our parents. I believe that the religion does not save, your faith does, however being surrounded by true believer make the path of spirituality much easier. My opinion and advice to you would be to keep learning about GOD words, read your Bible as often as possible get explanations on point that you do not understand clearly, and don't get involve in any debate yet give yourself a couple of more years to be ready to do so.... I'm not saying to hide that you love GOD, I'm saying not to debate on religion or faith for now.5	Who in Chicago Cubs history to get six hits in one game?

An electrical charge is an imbalance between an atom's positive and negative units (Protrons and electrons).  A discharge of electrical energy happens when electrons jump from one atom to on that is differently charged to bring the two atoms closer to a balance.  If an atom has more electrons that protons, it is negatively charged.  If it has more protons than electrons, then it is positively charged.  A charge is always changed by changing the number of electrons.  If you change the number of protons, it becomes a nuclear reacation since the change is happening in the nucleus of the atom.4	DSL help !!!?

This really depends on what your goal is whether strength, endurance, power, speed, flexibility, weight-loss, weight-gain, etc.  You would need to define your goals before establishing a suitable exercise regimen.  You will find that there is not any "best" exercise program and incoporating several types of methodologies can help you meet goals.  Any exercise is better than no exercise, but it could very well be that the exercise you do enjoy and can stick with is one that is contrary to your goals, so you really have to set out what you want out of your fitness first before you define your exercise program.3	which race or country are the most and least promiscous?  i suspect that as you check out the subject that generally people are the same all over. you probably will find some people that will say that one group or country is a tad different from the rest or that one country/group has more 'morals' than another. this will be supported solely thru antecdotal evidence. we are a single species and i suspect that sexual activities among human beings are universal.9	who is the president of the united states?  who cares1	how much restoril is fatal?

I personally feel that Adderall is too powerful a stimulant to be used in a panic-prone person but I am not a pharmacist (only a psychology graduate student who took psychopharmacology and loved it).  Please ask your doctor or better a pharmacist before taking that combination.  I doubt it would be fatal but it could cause a panic attack and would not likely be helpful in any way.4	the phone number to verizon dsl?  4112	Since I have been lifting weights i have been getting much stronger but not bigger.

I usually increase the weight slowly every time I visit the gym and don't really concentrate on high amounts of reps. Really no more than 8 reps of each lift for three sets. Sometimes I do 10 reps.

Maldives\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nMaldives (Diveti Rajje ge Jumhuriyya), island republic in southern Asia, located in the northern Indian Ocean, south-west of the southern tip of India. The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 2,000 small coral islands that are grouped into clusters of atolls. It has a total land area of 298 sq km (115 sq mi). The capital and largest city of the Maldives is Malé.\n\nII  LAND AND RESOURCES \n\nThe islands are low-lying and have only small tracts of arable land. Vegetation is dominated by coconut palms and breadfruit trees. The principal natural resource is the marine life of the surrounding seas. \n\nA  Climate \n\nThe climate is tropical and humid. The average annual temperature is 26.7° C (80° F), with little seasonal variation. The average annual precipitation is 1,524 mm (60 in), most of which falls between May and November.\n\nB  Environmental Concerns \n\nWith 80 per cent of the nation less than 1 metre (40 in) above sea level, the problem of global warming and resultant rising sea levels is a growing concern in the Maldives. The devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that hit the islands on December 26, 2004, flooded large areas of the islands. Significant population growth has led to overfishing around the islands, and the natural supply of fresh water is nearly exhausted.\n\nIII  POPULATION \n\nThe Maldives has a population of 339,330 (2004 estimate), yielding an average population density of 1,131 people per sq km (2,930 per sq mi). The most populous atolls are Malé, the capital and principal commercial centre, with a population of 84,000 (2001 estimate); Suvadiva; and Tiladummati. There are 20 political divisions based on the atolls: Alifu, Baa, Dhaalu, Faafu, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu, Gnaviyani, Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Kaafu, Laamu, Lhaviyani, Malé, Meemu, Noonu, Raa, Seenu, Shaviyani, Thaa, and Vaavu. The people are ethnically heterogeneous, incorporating Indian, Sinhalese, Arabian, and African elements. Life expectancy in 2004 was 62 years for men and 65 years for women.\n\nA  Religion \n\nIslam is the state religion; nearly all the people are Sunni Muslims.\n\nB  Language \n\nThe language is Divehi (Maldivian), an Indo-European tongue related to Sinhalese.\n\nC  Culture \n\nDivehi culture predominates and the best-known music-and-dance form is the bodu beru (Divehi; “big drum”). Participants include a lead singer and drummers as well as other percussionists and the tempo of the music and dance rise to a frenzied crescendo. Another form of dance, performed by women, is the bandiyaa jehun. The rhythm is tapped out on water pots. There is a National Museum of local exhibits at Malé.\n\nIV  ECONOMY \n\nThe Maldivian economy is dominated by fishing and fish products, which accounted for almost 85 per cent of all export trade in 1993, and tourism. The fish catch is primarily tuna; corals and shells are also harvested. Coconuts are the principal agricultural product; most food must be imported. Industrial activity is largely limited to fish-processing and garment-manufacturing.\n\nA  Tourism \n\nThe rapid growth of the tourist industry has necessitated improvements in the infrastructure of the country, such as the installation of telephones and other forms of communication. Tourism is the principal foreign currency earner for the Maldives, with approximately 485,000 tourist arrivals recorded in 2002. Earnings from tourism totalled US$38 million in 1997. Malé International Airport is the major point of arrival for tourists.\n\nB  Currency and Banking \n\nThe monetary unit of the Maldives is the rufiyaa, made up of 100 laari (12.69 rufiyaa equalled US$1; early 2004). Currency is issued by the Maldives Monetary Authority.\n\nV  GOVERNMENT \n\nThe Maldives is a republic governed under a constitution promulgated in 1968 and revised in 1997, with effect from 1998. The president is both chief of state and head of government and is elected every five years by the parliamentary assembly and5	Anyone eles out there a clippers fan? who is your fav. player Hell yeah.\n\nI know it's too obvious, but Elton Brand.

Improve your short game now, so that when your body matures and your start hitting the ball farther, your scores will begin to improve dramatically.\n\nI would also recommend reading "Golf is not a game of perfect" by Dr. Bob Rotella.  This is an awesome book that talks about the psychology of the game and course management.\n\nIf you practice smartly now, it will pay big dividends down the road.\n\nBy the way, I am currently 37 and carry 0.2 USGA handicap index.  I started playing when I was 12 and when I was 14, I was playing bogie golf (shooting 45ish for 9 holes and 90ish for 18).  I used the practice strategy I mentioned above and when I was approximately 16 or 17, I went from driving the ball from around 240 yards up to 300 yards.  During that same time frame, my score dropped from the mid 80s down to the low 70s.  This literally happened over the course of a couple months.  I went on to play high school  and college golf.\n\nAnyway, just have fun, keep a good attitude and enjoy the outdoors.  Best of luck,3	How can an Indian non-medical(12th grade) student get addmission in a gud university in the u.s? jus passed the 12th grade exam securing 75%, and wants to go in 4 an engineering degree.........

This is more of personal question rather than an educational question...\n\nCan you sell memberships on EBay for a website you own.\nExample:\nNormal charge for GOLD membership = £7 a month\nBut by selling off 300 memberships on Ebay for an EBAY membership type which goes for free for life, would be considered as having facevalue and also an offer compared to the standard gold membership charges.\n\nIf you compare the Gold account being £7 a month (£84 a year)\nThe EBAY type would be just the bid there after its free for life\n\nGold\nYear 1 = £84\nYear 2 = £168\nYear 4 = £336\nYear 8 = £672\n\nEbay Account would just be the final bid costs and free for life there after *Life being 100 Years maximum should the website even last that long* Here's some of the Memberships being sold now on eBay:\nhttp://everythingelse.search.ebay.com/membership_Memberships_W0QQcatrefZC12QQfromZR8QQfsooZ1QQfsopZ1QQsacatZ16709\n\nHowever, you will have to state the terms very precisely and state for instance:  $84 for 1 year (this would be an auction) or $500 Lifetime Membership (this would be a separate auction).\n\nIn order to describe your Membership, you can compare your opening bid price to value ie:  1 year regularly $84 buy-it-now for $50 or low opening bid of $50 (you get the picture).\n\nCheck out my eBay Tips page here:\nhttp://www.themainsail.net/helppg.html\n\nIf you send me a link to your auction, I'll post it free on my website.

She has cronic lower back pain which means her legs give in at any time and therefore she is unable to go out. She is constantly in pain and cannot sit down she has to lie on one side. Before she was like this she had kidney stones could there be a link? It's most likely a spine problem of some sort.  The spine controls the nerves and the nerves in turn control the muscles. If the legs are weak and he/she is having back pain, most liekly their is something gong on with the spine.

It DEPENDS UPON YOUR PROBLEM.\nArtificiaI Intelligence=AI\nAI divides roughly into two schools of thought: Conventional AI and Computational Intelligence (CI).\n\nConventional AI mostly involves methods now classified as machine learning, characterized by formalism and statistical analysis. This is also known as symbolic AI, logical AI, neat AI and Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI). (Also see semantics.) Methods include:\n\nExpert systems: apply reasoning capabilities to reach a conclusion. An expert system can process large amounts of known information and provide conclusions based on them. \nCase based reasoning \nBayesian networks \nBehavior based AI: a modular method of building AI systems by hand. \nComputational Intelligence involves iterative development or learning (e.g. parameter tuning e.g. in connectionist systems). Learning is based on empirical data and is associated with non-symbolic AI, scruffy AI and soft computing. Methods mainly include:\n\nNeural networks: systems with very strong pattern recognition capabilities. \nFuzzy systems: techniques for reasoning under uncertainty, have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. \nEvolutionary computation: applies biologically inspired concepts such as populations, mutation and survival of the fittest to generate increasingly better solutions to the problem. These methods most notably divide into evolutionary algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms) and swarm intelligence (e.g. ant algorithms). \nWith hybrid intelligent systems attempts are made to combine these two groups. Expert inference rules can be generated through neural network or production rules from statistical learning such as in ACT-R. It is thought that the human brain uses multiple techniques to both formulate and cross-check results. Thus, integration is seen as promising and perhaps necessary for true AI.4	How do i get rid of the virus, cc apps? any ideas greatly apprieciated?  download Norton Antivirus and run the application. you can look up on their site and get free removal tools also. www.nortonantivirus.com2	What is Pars Plana?

What are other possiblilities?  Industrialization sure contributes to the phenomenon known as global warming. But, if I am to understand correctly, then, according to a scientist featured in a program I once came across on the Discovery Channel (Canada), a couple of hundred million years ago, a most unique event occurred, one most rare and that never before occurred in earth's history.\n\nThere are 4 things that can and do dramatically affect the earth's temperature, besides the heat generated by its core. These are volcanic eruptions, especially gigantice ones such as the 1883 eruption of Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia, comet, asteroid and meteroic impacts, what phase the earth is in during its orbit around the sun and, finally, how far towards or away from the sun the axis it revolves around is tilting.\n\nAny one of these can reduce the earth's overall temperature and make for a harsher and/or longer winter. Two of these create truly severe conditions. But a couple of hundred million years ago, the incredible happened. The earth was in the long and most distant portion of its orbit around the sun, the portion we associate with winter, its axis was at its furthest possible tilt from the sun and it suffered a collision with a space object (though it's not clear yet whether this was a comet or an asteroid).\n\nThe fact that it was during its long, winter phase meant that the earth would be cold to begin with and would receive less light and heat from the sun than usual. The fact that its axis was at its furthest point from the sun meant that the winter season would be that much harsher and would last that much longer than usual. But the combined effect of all 3 factors created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe winter season meant that temperatures were cold to begin with and that there was snow and ice on the ground already. The distantly pointing axis and the particulates from the collision kept temperatures cold and reduced them further. This meant that come spring and summer, much less snow and ice melted than usual and at a much slower rate. This in turn meant that by the time the next winter season came, the precipitation (snow and ice) of the last one was still for the most part on the ground. This created a larger mass of ice and snow, which froze into ice. This larger mass further sucked even more heat from the air around it and the ground below it. That further reduced temperatures, which caused even more precipitation to fall and accumulate, resulting in an even larger mass of ice and snow. This created permanent glaciars and permitted the creation and growth of pernanent icecaps at the 2 poles. These events have since locked the earth in an ice age. An ice age has two periods, a warming period and a cooling period. \n\nSo what does this have to do with global warming you ask? Until such time as at least some scientists became convinced of the phenomenon you know as global warming, the earth was in a warming period. It is my opinion and belief, given the available data, that, just as the earth experienced the simultaneous occurrance of 3 factors that allowed the creation of permanent glaciars and polar ice-caps, it can also experience the simultaneous occurrance of factors at the other end of the spectrum and that that is what the earth is experiencing right now. So I believe that the phenomenon of global warming is natural, and thus I support it, but that is aggravated by industrialization (mostly the various forms of pollution and environmental degredation), which I do not support.\n\nWhatever your goals and intentions, the best thing you can do is to gather the maximum amount of available information, and understand what theories are being expounded and how many acknowledged figures support them, so as to be able to accurately and fairly perceive the situation as it truly is and form an informed and educated opinion about it. Finally, not to be selective or act as a form of propaganda, I highly recommend "State of Fear" by Mr. Micha3	I look for the list/chart of law/rules in kindergarten?  please rephrase your question i don't understand what you are asking2	health care crises a serious matter every one sould participate in this.?

Calmecita, they were doing fine in the pond yesterday, maybe 5-6 days after hatching.  Today I went out and I don't see any.  I don't have fish in there.  The water looks kind of greeny scummy today. Hi! Well, it _is_ normal for tadpoles to have high mortality rates. After all, only a few of the hundreds of eggs will finally grow into adult frogs or toads. Some are eaten by birds, some are parasitized or just die because they were not well developed.\nBut if it is a large enough pond, at least some tadpoles will grow normally. And remember what I said about the water (I left comments in the other question): if it is not at least partly renewed, the concentration of ammonia will rise too much.\n\nOh, and another thing. When they first hatch, the tadpoles still have a bit of yolk from the egg and do not feed; only after a few days they develop their horny beaks and start scraping the algae. So it might be that now they're staying closer to the bottom surface, and that's why they're less visible. \nI'm including a link to a site that shows the developmental stages for most tadpoles. The stages are numbered from 1 to 46, but the time it takes for the entire process to be completed depends on the species and also on environmental conditions: \nhttp://www.trentu.ca/biology/tadpole/Webstage2.htm\n\nTry to catch a few and see which stage they're at :-)\n-------------\nPS I've just read the last comment.

Is this possible. So, how long have you had these feelings of wanting to have relations with other people? This is clearly a voice screaming out for some attention. You need to stop before you do some serious damage to your relationship with your husband. When you start making assumptions, this leads to accusations.

Does anyone that lives in Ohio think that its fair that us smokers have to give up smoking in public places because of people that cant be around smoke? I live in Ohio and I'm a smoker.  I believe that in certain cases it is fine to not allow smoking, like in office buildings and court houses and the like.  I also believe that the owner of the property should be able to decide whether or not he wants to allow smoking.  As in privately owned restaurants and bars.  These places may be public in the sense that anyone off the street can go in there and sit down and have a meal/drink.  However, its like listening to bad music, if you don't like it, don't listen.  If you don't like that people are smoking in a certain restaurant, don't go there.  It's called choice and the fact that some people don't smoke or don't want to be around smoke shouldn't limit the number of places smokers can go and enjoy a meal or drink and be able to have a cigarette when finished.  Also, it is ridiculous to make people stay fifty feet or whatever from the entrance to a building.  Outside there are many other carcinogens in the air besides smoke that people breathe in every minute of every day.  Not to mention that being outside in itself takes away the second-hand smoke factor.6	In a sole proprietorship, can you hire consultants to do work and not have to worry about tax issues?

Ideally, I'd pay them for the work and it would then be their responsibility to pay the taxes.\n\nCan this be done with a sole proprietorship and if not, HOW can it be done? 1099 them as independent contractors\n or just pay them under the table like everybody else...2	do any of you inhale correction fluid(containing toluene) ? have any idea whats are its ill-effects ? am talkin bout the white fluid ( whitener ) used for making corrections when you have  typed in something wrong...\n\nit gives a high when inhaled and it had toluene..could someone tell me how bad toluene is ? Toluene is so toxic that OSHA has restricted exposure to employees who come in contact with it at work. It is a hydrocarbon which can trigger asthma. It affects the Central Nervous System and cause euphoria, dizziness, confusion,depression, headache, vertigo, hallucinations, seizures, vision problems ,stupor, and coma. It may have direct on the Cardiac System. It can cause bronchial spasms and suffocation. Long-term exposure can damage the liver, kidneys, and skin. Inhaling this solvent can even cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. \nI have personally known people who had used it as a 'high' (sniffing correction fluid). They were in a mental hospital facility and had permanent brain damage. They had difficulty speaking. Their symptoms were like those of alcoholics with 'wet brain'. There is no recovery for them.\nIt is a SCARY chemical.9	i believe that the death penalty should be bought back to the UK? how many murders and child rapes do you think would have been stopped if the person committing the crime knew that the rope awaited them if caught...a lot i think...and how many of these perverts and murders get out of prison after a few years ...TO MANY.....I SAY BRING BACK THE NOOSE NOW i totally agree with you, these days what with dna its easier to prove someone is guilty, so when its proven that someone is 100% guilty, yeah, hang em!  especially paedophiles they are the lowest of the low\n\nas for ians answer it may of been proven to not prevent further people killing but at least its less of a burden on the tax payer supporting scum like that in prison0	GUYS --> If you had to get the soles of your barefeet tickled, what would you want them tickled with?

Well, besides looking in your local newspapers, you could begin by going to the area service station which have auto service facilities.  These establishments rent/lease out their service pits to people/mechanics for a fee.  Then, you are required to get your own business insurance along with whatever else is needed.\nKeep in mind, with gas/service stations, at least here in Michigan, the owners all know each other.  So once you begin your search, chances are you will be referred to the right location.\nHope this information proves to be useful.5	Why doesn't Yahoo Answers have "Guns" category?

Work units: Joule, or N-m for mech work\n\nThe rate at which work is performed is power.\nPower units: watts, or Joule/sec\n\nIn physics, energy is said to be the ability to do work; the strict mathematical definition of energy in physics always being the amount of work itself (done by or against specified force).\nEnergy has the same units as work; a force applied through a distance. The SI unit of energy, the joule, equals one newton applied through one meter, for example. Energy has no direction in space, and is therefore considered a scalar quantity.9	they are rioting again in france should we send bullets or gasoline?

I have a friend that is very confused, she's married and loves her husband but at the same time she's having an affair with a guy she's always been in love with for over 10 years, she's known him longer than her husband.This has been going on for almost 3 years and she hasn't been caught. I really care for her and don't want her to get hurt when she gets caught cause then she'll loose both.She says she loves both of them...\nShe's thought about divorcing, but she says she loves her husband and she couldn't go thru with it. I honestly don't believe that one can be in love, with 2 people. I do however believe that she does love one, while she is in lust with the other. For her own benefit and the sake of the others, she needs to figure out which one is which. All your friend is doing right now is being selfish. She's having her cake and eating it too. I don't think she will end this until she's forced to and the only way that is going to happen is if she's caught. You might be her friend and all but this isn't right and someone should tip her husband off, if you know what i mean.2	flexible partials vs. metal partials?

This particular concept would involve developing a material that simulates tree bark by using nanotechnology to build new "cells" which would be formed by using microscopic chips from the special material's underside extracted by the micromachines, carried to the upper surface where they react with sun and rainwater to form a new "skin" that bonds to the roof.  The cycle continues until the machines die.  But then can be rejuvenated with a special maintenance coating with fresh machines to continue the work.  Basically, you have a simulated organic roof (real organic material could also be used) that never needs replacing in the lifetime of a house or commercial building. Don't think you can patent it, but its called grass its organic only needs trimming now and again and grows year in year out.2	how can you get rid of leg fat in your house without anything really.? im not fat but i would like my calfs to be skinnier Walk around on your tippy toes and that will help exercise your calves...also just standing and boucing up them will help too...:)0	moozlim_on_crank....Part  One.? Istar was a daughter of Sin. Sacrifices to the Moon-god are described in the Pas Shamra texts. In the Ugaritic texts, the Moon-god was sometimes called Kusuh. In Persia, as well as in Egypt, the Moon-god is depicted on wall murals and on the heads of statues. He was the Judge of men and gods. The Old Testament constantly rebuked the worship of the Moon-god (see: Deut. 4:19;17:3; II Kngs. 21:3,5; 23:5; Jer. 8:2; 19:13; Zeph. 1:5, etc.) When Israel fell into idolatry, it was usually the cult of the Moon-god.

And if it's not the answer, why don't we get rid of it all together and let the free market set the standard.

During that time so many buisnesses went under, but now we have so much money in our pockets from this economy that we can all go but every new device they dangle in front of us any time they do. clinton was horrible he raised taxes( the biggest tax hike in american history), fired more than 1 million people in his fianl 2 years, the economy was going into a recession before bush fixed that, kept all of the hard earned money by the american workers for himself and didnt spend it on anything like border protection the war ( he had 7 chances to kill bin laden and didnt, 9/11 was his fault), bush gave back 1.4 trillion dollars to the american people, lowered taxes GWB RULES2	is musterbation more than two times a day harmful?

Engineers pour the concrete into metal forms, and remove the forms when the concrete dries.\n\n2. Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\n\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \n\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.7	The President on 24?

She stills wants friendship, but I want more? my ex girlfriend (she's 30)and i,i'm 36, had a 2 and half relationship w/ and now been ex's since a year and half, wants me still be as a "family" member and wants to be just friends ,even though we were very close to being lovers on a trip we just took a month ago. Is now still "seeing/dating" the father (19yrs), of their twin girls they had 3 months ago, says that if i was just a friend now and stop making her stressed or also stop making advances and just be there for her and hang out. That we could possibly work things out in the future. Yet when I try to deal , the father is always there and it makes me feel like a third wheel.  Am I wrong asking for time just with her, and how can i deal if she just gets mad at me when i just want time w/ her.I love her still so much, but how can i just bite my lip. I know she sometimes says she wants "us" back.Everyone says she is using me. I take her places and do alot  4her since he cannot, and yet I get no intimacy,and he does.Hes apuppet4her I once saw a Saturday Night Live sketch where a lady goes to see a psychologist and runs off for a full five minutes about all the things in her life that went wrong and all the areas that are now out of control. The psychologist told her to pay him $500 up front and he would tell her what she needed to do to solve all her problems. She reluctantly paid him and after a few seconds of staring at her, he simply said two words... 'stop it'.\n\nI offer the same advise to you, for free. \nThis relationship is not healthy because it has no outlet. If you give something, ANYTHING, it must be returned. If not, you must show enough respect for yourself to seek it elsewhere. I don't mean that in a bad way, but you must demand respect for every thing you have to offer, for if you don't. No one else can be expected to. \n\nIf you want things to get better, make better choices.2	what should i do? my friend thinks she is too fat because people laugh when she says she weighs 96lb & shes 12  That's not Fat!!!!!!!

I met a guy online about 3 years ago over this time weve chatted and texted and kept in touch constantly, over the last year we became closer and as i moved closer to where he lived with work we met up and began seeing each other- things we going really well as we already knew each other because of the time we have previously spent talking online.\nBut recently i sensed something wasnt quite right and found out he has had a girlfriend for a year he says he didnt know how to tell me as he didnt want to loose what we had and that they were drifting apart and he wants to be with me but needs time to sort it out. should i forgive him and try make it work ? Decide how much you like him.  Nobody is beyond redemption, if you think its worth another shot lay down the rules and give him that chance. \n\nPeople make mistakes reading your short paragraph I can see his angst.  You have been together for 2 years its a safe bet you had invested romance into things so his proably felt lost about the correct thing to do (believe me it happens a lot!)

Without you being close he had no compelling reason to ruin that by telling you he had a girlfriend.  (This is a crappy thing to do but thats human nature people just don't deal with stuff till they have to)\n\nNo way has he had 3 years of lies with you players don't invest like that...no return for them you know?  So its a safe bet a good deal of what he has told you is true about him.\n\nI'd suggest letting him work it out without you pressuring him.  If he chooses you while your scarce you know its what you share between you that made him choose you.9	Children as a war victims?

I am taking the anti deppresion pill eeferox 175mg 1 daily\nI have been taking them now for over two months.  I still have the side effects to these pills.  Should I be worried about it?  How long do the side effects suppose to last? I'm wondering why you put this in 'alternative medicine'.  Good alternatives to the meds are plenty of exercise and St John's Wort is the herbal equivalent to a well-known anti-depressant.  The meds are just blocking the symptoms and not getting to the source.  You will always have side effects and they are also addictive, so you would need to come off them gradually.\n\n\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/spiritualhealing6	What do you do if your mom does not like your music.?

He was a pitcher for the Boston before he became a pernament outfielder and hitter. he wanted to be in the game everyday, so he worked on his hitting. when he was traded to the Yankees, he became one of the best home run hitters of all time. He has a carreer of 714 homers. he also has a record of hitting 60 homers in a season, but it has been broken by several players (Ex: Roger Maris, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa). When he was still a pitcher, he was good. at one season, he was 18-8 (won 18, lost 8). He went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and 9 shutouts in 1916; the shutout mark is still tied for the best mark for an A.L. left hander. in 1917, he was 24-13 and he has an average of .325. he has a carreer of 94 wins, 46 losses, a  2.24 ERA, and 488 strike outs.7	Can you imagine the horror of being torn from your home, family and everything you knew at the age of 6 or 8 o What if circumstances forced you to leave everything familiar in your life behind forever?

They walked hundreds of miles on a frightening journey to safety. \n\nMany died from starvation, disease and attacks by humans and animals along the way. Those who survived made it to refugee camps in Ethiopia.\n\nOne of these "Lost Boys" and Dave Eggers have now collaborated in a novel blending fact and imagination called "What Is the What." In it Eggers describes the many traumas the children faced during their travels. sounds interesting, thanks for the tip\n\n\nand to answer your question: no I can't imagine how hard that would be.9	What are the names of leading companies that manipulate the republican government?

Conference leaders: Bears (9-1) Cowboys (7-4) Saints (7-4) Seahawks (6-4; play MNF)\n\nWhich two teams are going to make the playoffs?  Or will a 4 win team not mentioned (GB, WAS) make it the below mentioned teams?\n\nHere are all the NFC teams in the wildcard race \n\n6-5 Giants schedule\nvs DAL\n@ CAR\nvs PHI\nvs NO\n@ WAS\n\n6-5 Panthers schedule\n@ PHI\nvs NYG\nvs PIT\n@ ATL\n@ NO\n\n5-6 49ers schedule\n@ NO\nvs GB\n@ SEA\nvs ARZ\n@ DEN\n\n5-6 Eagles schedule\nvs CAR\n@ WAS\n@ NYG\n@ DAL\nvs ATL\n\n5-6 Falcons Schedule\n@ Was\n@ TB \nvs DAL\nvs CAR\n@ PHI\n\n5-6 Rams Schedule\nvs ARZ\nvs CHI\n@ OAK\nvs WAS\n@ MIN\n\n5-6 Vikings schedule\n@ CHI\n@ DET\nvs NYJ\n@ GB\nvs STL Well, first I'll eliminate teams I think that wont make the playoffs. The Vikings will most likely finish 8-8, the Falcons have dug themselves a hole and I think its too deep to get out of, the Eagles arent contenders without McNabb, and the Niners have their three toughest games on the road with 5 games left. \n\nSo I see the Rams, Panthers/Saints, and Giants battling for the NFC wildcards.\n\nWith the way the Giants are playing right now, I dont see them standing much of a chance with their tough schedule left. If they get back to playing Giant football and come out and beat Dallas next week, theyre right back in the mix. If they lose that game, count them out.\n\nThe Rams have been choking, but might have saved their season yesterday vs the Niners. I see them going 4-1 in their final 5 games and clinching a spot in the playoffs at 9-7.\n\nI think Carolina will actually finish 10-6 as well as the Saints and end up winning the tie breaker over the Saints. Giving the Saints the other wild card.\n\nAs for Seattle, Shaun has to get back on the horse and get some yards to help Hassleback get into a groove. If Shaun and Hassleback are banged up like they have been all season, I wouldnt be suprise if they ended up forfeiting the NFC West to St.Louis or San Fran and missing out of the playoffs.8	why can't guys see the good in a girl even if she's fat??? EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL????? ok,im VERY different then the 14 year old people in my high school.  I'm not skinny-mini, i'm ,the dreaded word, FAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but, i am okay looking, but still, guys have NEVER asked me out.  my freinds have b.f.'s and i dont. i mean, they'll be telling me sumthing about having a boyfreind,or being kissed, and they will say,"you know?"   but i DON'T!!    i mean, ive really tried to lose weight, dieting, and everything else, but it doesn't last for long..... i just need HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First things first, don't be dieting unless you are obese. If you're just overweight, it is a very bad time in your life to be doing that to your growing body.\n\nSecond, since you're 14, you're probably a freshman. I have to say, you really don't need to be going out with guys right now. Not only is it just too young, but guys are really not finding themselves yet, and until guys find themselves, they won't be able to see the beautiful, true you. I hate how it works, but I also strongly dislike shallow people and avoid them.\n\nSo basically, it is unlikely that there are many guys your age who can actually see behind the mask, which I know is a travesty but it's just what media does to us.\n\nPlus, having a boyfriend at this age, although is scattered with good times, is wrought with bad times and hurt feelings. Just wait for a little while, and when the right guy comes along you'll know.\n\nBest of luck to you!1	Has anyone got a figure----life cycle og humans(reproduction)?

Hi!\nFirst of all, if the galaxy ends... so does the earth since the earth is part of the galaxy!\nI don't think there are any theories as to the end of any galaxy specifically, but there is a theory that the Universe is currently expanding from the time of the Big Bang (which is scientifically considered the beginning of the universe) and one day, the universe will stop expanding and start to contract.\n\nSo, in simple terms, scientists believe that the universe strated from a single point in empty space, that point exploded into the universe (an event called the Big Bang) and since then, all the objects in the universe (all the galaxies etc.) are moving away from this point. Basically the theory says that the explosion is still going on and will continue for a few billion more years. At some point in the future, the objects in the universe will stop moving away from the point of the initial explosion. Once that happens, scientists have different theories about what happens next. \nSome believe that the universe will just stop moving and stay that way forever (Steady State Theory). Some believe that gravity will pull the whole universe all the way back to the starting position and then the whole universe will become a single point in empty space again (just like in the beginning) and that will be the end of the universe. Other scientists believe that when the universe returns to that same point again, it will explode again, and so this will keep going on forever (I.e. the universe will keep exploding and reforming and exploding over and over again). There are some other theories but these are the main ones.\n\nRegardless, scientists believe that we may never know what will happen because almost all scientists agree that in 5 billion years time (or so) the sun will die (also known as "going nova") and in its death will burn the entire solar system in what we call a nova explosion. So unless we can find another planet outside of this solar system to inhabit, we won't see the end of the universe!\n\nSuddenly believing in God seems like the much safer option - at least we have a chance then!\n\nSorry, I just want to reinforce this comment, the sun WILL NOT go supernova and become a white dwarf it is far too small, it can only go nova (becoming a red super giant - which actually makes it the size of the solar system not just to mars' orbit - remembering that the nova is in fact an explosion, the surface of the sun is blasted outward and is likely to go beyond the edge of the solar system) and then the core will collapse on itself.\n\nHope that helped,\nFahed9	Should the draft be reinstated in the U.S.?

I am not a nurse, but I work with a lot of them in a hospital and I see the job postings.  Most job postings are looking for BS RN.  More opportunity for you if you go that route, more advancement, management etc.  BIGGER PAYCHECKS.\n\nBut do not let that stop you, if you can become a Registered Nurse without it then go for it.  You can always get the BS degree later on.\n\nGood luck.3	What are Florida's 4 major industries?

In some cases, I think this is true...but not the majority of cases. \n\nSome movies have a great compilation of popular songs that really tie a story together...esp. 80s movies or movies like "Grosse Point Blank" about a high school reunion that is filled with songs from the character's high school period.\n\nAlso, Musicals often have a weaker plot and are tied together by songs, so in those cases, I think the music determines the success of the storyline.\n\nOther movies have a very strong score that is unforgettable...ie. Superman, Star Wars, etc.  I think in those cases the score really boosts the already strong storyline.2	What are some non prescription sleep meds that really work???  As with all medications and all over the counter meds  you should talk with your MD. It would depend on why you are not sleeping. Before you try medication you should look at whether or not you can change some bed time habits first. Don't consume caffeine before bed. Start to relax and let go of the day about an hour before bed. Try to meditate. If all this fails carefully try something over the counter. The main ingredient in most sleep aids is Benadryl. So before you go spending alot of money on alot of products, you might want to try simple benadryl allergy tablets. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions.5	pensez-vous que Federer va gagner le masters de cette année?  J'adore Roger et je pense qu'il est vraiment au-dessus du lot cette fois encore!

Removing a wisdom teeth can be either a simple extraction or a surgical extraction.Upper wisdom teeth are usually a simple extraction.For our bones in the maxilla(our upper jaw)is porous,which makes it the upper wisdom teeth to remove easily.Where as the lower wisdom teeth,bones in the mandible(our lower jaw)are dense,which make it harder to remove it.And lower wisdom teeth are usually impacted,though not all,so that means taking a impacted wisdom teeth will involve making a flap(cutting your gums)and sectioning(splitting the tooth into 2 or more)the tooth.and a stitches will be put on,a disolvable.There are some risk factor in taking a wisdom teeth,that you should be aware of.One is,there are some nerves involve in taking a lower wisdom teeth that will cause a permanent numbness.And some will have a broken jaw.Discuss further about wisdom teeth to your Dentist before the operation.5	If there were commentator-less sports on TV, would you watch more frequently?  Yes.\n\nI agree with some of the other comments on here that WELL-DONE commentary can add to the experience of the sporting event on television.   However, the operative word is "WELL-DONE."  I don't think that most commentary done on television these days is done WELL anymore at all.  \n\nConsider Dick Vitale.  He's got a mind of his own.  I love listening to Dick..."You can't stop him...you can only hope to contain him!"  or "He's epiflectic, baby!"  Dick Vitale IS the charismatic, enthusiastic voice of the Big Dance.  His commentary is done WELL.\n\nYour opinions may vary.  But I'm the guy who really enjoyed HGTV's presentation of the Tournament of Roses Parade for several years because they offered it WITHOUT commentary (sadly, they added commentators this year).   I'm the guy who watches the State of the Union address on C-Span because I don't need the commentators to regurgitate what I just saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.8	how do u know when your man love u and only u?

However, if God is putting a different conviction on YOUR heart, that is a different story.  Darling, I will pray for you to receive wisdom in your decision.  My best suggestion is for you and hubby to pray together and seperately about it.  Search the Word, ask God to give you an answer to your problem.  Don't forget, as a Christian, anything that is on your heart is also on His.  Only He can tell you what He wants you to do.8	good time to call? When is it a good time to call my g'f. I know its a wierd question. but just wondering. 8 pm sunday b 4 school? call before dinner, like 5pm.  that way, if she prefers an evening call, she can tell you when or even call her back.  then you don't have to worry about an angry dad yelling at you for calling "too late"2	why do I wake up gasping for breath? Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and its like I,ve forgotton how to breathe! I have to force myself to draw in breath, or cough or something.It's quite a scary thing at the time. Perhaps you have sleep apnea or some other sleeping or breathing disorder.  Consult your doctor and they can run some tests to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep apnea (alternatively sleep apnoea) is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. These episodes, called apneas, last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. People with sleep apnea partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they may not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep.\n\nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. \nCentral sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brain’s normal signals to breathe. \n\n\nSymptoms\nThe hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, weight gain, increased heart rate, anxiety, and depression. Obstructive Sleep Apnea is more likely to occur in men than in women, and in people who are overweight or obese.\n\n[edit]\nHistory\nConsidering how common a condition it is, it is remarkable that the first reports of what is now called obstructive sleep apnea date only from 1965 when it was independently described by French and German investigators. The term “Pickwickian syndrome”, inspired by Charles Dickens' account in The Pickwick Papers of Joe, the fat boy, has been used in medicine to describe various conditions associated with obesity, excessive appetite and sleepiness and it was once presumed to be due to an endocrine problem. “Pickwickian syndrome” soon became the descriptor for the newly identified disorder but as more cases were recognized it became clear that neither obesity nor somnolence were necessarily present. “Pickwickian” was later reserved for “the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome” and today the term is best avoided because of its ill-defined meaning.\n\nThe early reports of sleep apnea described individuals who were very severely affected, often presenting with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia and congestive heart failure. Tracheostomy was the recommended treatment and, though it could be life-saving, post-operative complications in the stoma were frequent in these very obese and short-necked individuals.\n\nThe management of obstructive sleep apnea was revolutionized with the introduction of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), first described in 1981 by Colin Sullivan and associates in Sydney, Australia. The first models were bulky and noisy but the design was rapidly improved and by the late 1980s CPAP was widely adopted. The availability of an effective treatment stimulated an aggressive search for affected individuals and led to the establishment of hundreds of specialized clinics dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Though many types of sleep problems are recognized, the vast majority of patients attending these centers have sleep disordered breathing.\n\n[edit]\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n \nTwo minute epoch representing continuous OSA. Click on this image for larger version.Most people with sleep apnea have obstructive apnea, in which the person stops breathing during sleep due to airway blockage. Sufferers usually resume breathing within a few seconds, but periods of as long as sixty seconds are not uncommon in serious cases. It is more common amongst people who snore, who are obese, who consume alcohol, or who have anatomical abnormalities of the jaw or soft palate. However, atypical cases do occur, and the condition should not be ruled out unilaterally merely because the patient does not fit the profile.\n\n"OSA" is caused by the relaxation of the muscles in the airway durin1	who invented languages?

For that to be true he would have to have absolute power.  And anyone who thinks he did have absolute power, needs to brush up on their American government.\n\nActually, that is incorrect.  A) Republicans do not control the Supreme Court, though they do like to take more than their fair share of power, not matter whose appointees are on the bench.  B) Rep. can hardly be called a cohesive unit - just as the democrats cannot.  These are individual people, though they share many beliefs, they are not all 100% for touting the party line (which would have to be true for them to have absolute power).  An example of this woul be the recent immigration debate, where several Republicans did not join their party majority, but sided with the Dems.  I must assume that when you said that is as close as they can come to absolute power, you meant is our form of government.  Otherwise, you would be dead wrong.6	whoever gets BOTH of these right (and is the first) gets my 10 points!!!!? (1.)What is the plastic thing on the end of a shoelace called?\n\n(2.)

No, they can't come to your house. They could sue you and garnish your wages and clean out your bank accounts, but that's rather unlikely unless you owed the $8K to one creditor. Your credit will be ruined. You cannot be arrested for debts in the U.S.\n\nYou will not have a fresh start because the back marks will remain on your credit keeping you from establishing good trade lines the whole seven years. You will also be in a different category for having had bed debts than other consumers who paid on time.\n\nYes, try to make a deal with the creditor, if not, consumer credit counseling can probably help you. Don't just try to hide and ride it out. You'll thank yourself for being proactive and getting this behind you now rather than waiting.6	My bank wont give me a loan even though I have good credit because my credit isnt established enough yet ...?

It would be more proper to ask, "What is the mass of planet Earth?"1 The quick answer to that is: approximately 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (6E+24) kilograms. \n\nThe interesting sub-question is, "How did anyone figure that out?" It's not like the planet steps onto the scale each morning before it takes a shower. The measurement of the planet's weight is derived from the gravitational attraction that the Earth has for objects near it. \n\nIt turns out that any two masses have a gravitational attraction for one another. If you put two bowling balls near each other, they will attract one another gravitationally. The attraction is extremely slight, but if your instruments are sensitive enough you can measure the gravitational attraction that two bowling balls have on one another. From that measurement, you could determine the mass of the two objects. The same is true for two golf balls, but the attraction is even slighter because the amount of gravitational force depends on mass of the objects. \n\nNewton showed that, for spherical objects, you can make the simplifying assumption that all of the object's mass is concentrated at the center of the sphere. The following equation expresses the gravitational attraction that two spherical objects have on one another: \n\nF = G * M1 * M2 / R2 \nR is the distance separating the two objects. \nG is a constant that is 6.67259x10-11m3/s2 kg. \nM1 and M2 are the two masses that are attracting each other. \nF is the force of attraction between them. \nAssume that Earth is one of the masses (M1) and a 1-kg sphere is the other (M2). The force between them is 9.8 kg*m/s2 -- we can calculate this force by dropping the 1-kg sphere and measuring the acceleration that the Earth's gravitational field applies to it (9.8 m/s2). \n\nThe radius of the Earth is 6,400,000 meters (6,999,125 yards). If you plug all of these values in and solve for M1, you find that the mass of the Earth is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms (6E+24 kilograms / 1.3E+25 pounds). \n\n1 It is "more proper" to ask about mass rather than weight because weight is a force that requires a gravitational field to determine. You can take a bowling ball and weigh it on the Earth and on the moon. The weight on the moon will be one-sixth that on the Earth, but the amount of mass is the same in both places. To weigh the Earth, we would need to know in which object's gravitational field we want to calculate the weight. The mass of the Earth, on the other hand, is a constant.1	company for cemecal at espaniea?  Can you give us more info?3	career in bio chemistry?

Why waste your time on this stupid yahoo. If I believed that this life was all there was, that once I die I fade into non existence. I would want to do all I can to make this the best life I know how. Not knowing when it will end or if I am going to be jilted out of it. Knowing when those I love die, all they stood for all that they where is gone forever. Even having a "bad day" it cannot be recovered it is lost. That all I ever worked for all my accomplishments every thing I have earned, bought, and saved to be scavenged by someone else. All I was, to be forgotten never mentioned, my existence in all of time meaningless and of no importance. Snuffed out in an instant of time never to exist again. Only DNA to pass on though even that is not your conscience only a mixed conglomerate of you and another DNA sample. When you where born you have nothing and in your death you will have nothing.  I am sorry but that’s a very depressing life. I realize that no one reads this when I just link to it, so here is my answer to a previous version of this question:\n\nI believe that I have been nothing but courteous to the people of faith here. I openly deny their belief-system. They openly deny mine. That's fine. We have, however, engaged in some very respectful debate, much to the benefit (I hope) of both sides. I know that my beliefs have not changed, but my preconceptions about young-Earth Christians have been shattered by some of the people I have found here. I think that they are wrong, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to debate with them without resorting to name-calling or rudeness.\n\nGranted, this requires an openness on both our parts. I think that their faith is "wrong." They think that my lack of faith is "wrong." This is where most people get hung up and debate can go no further. If someone disagreeing with you is "offensive," you're stuck. Once you accept this disagreement, you are quite free to exchange ideas. This is what I have found here (for the most part.)\n\nAs for why I spend so much time in the religion and spirituality forum, I see faith as playing a huge role in the lives of everyone in the world, be they moderate Muslims, fundamentalist Christians, Pagans, or Atheists like myself.\n\nIn my supposedly free country I see gays discriminated against due to faith. People who would never think of using the N-word openly hate and criticize homosexuals for what they are, not who they are. \n\nI see medical advances that could help millions of people stymied by arguments that have their basis in faith. Stem cell research could potentially ease the suffering of billions around the globe, but people of faith stand in the way.\n\nWe are currently involved in what may or may not be a holy war. This is an issue of faith.\n\nOur current government supports "faith-based initiatives" in what may be a breach of The Constitution itself.\n\nI know that faith helps people sleep at night. This doesn't undo the tremendous amount of suffering it has inflicted at every turn of history. \n\nI see faith as a problem, and would like to encourage people to put aside their myths and embrace reason. However, I realize that this is futile. As Jonathan Swift said, "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."\n\nThat said, I think that Yahoo Answers provides a wonderful opportunity to try to see where other people are coming from. I disagree with the Christians (and Muslims and Pagans...), but I think it is very important for me to try to understand them. I would hope that they will try to understand me. Once we find some common ground and some mutual respect, we can truly start to talk about things.\n\nI hate the name-calling. The largest problem I have with religion is that it is divisive. I feel that this is the most important aspect of faith that needs to be removed from the equation. Name-calling is also divisive and does not fit into my attempts to act reasonably.\n\nI feel that I deny, but do not scoff. I embrace and enjoy open debate. I think that the things discussed here are important. I'd like to think that some of the things I have to say are pertinent. \n\nIf you want a place for only Christians (for example) to exchange ideas, there are plenty of places on the web for that. However, I think that this exclusion of other mindsets and worldviews does a disservice to those who would seek such a closed system.\n\nThat's why, as an atheist, I show up on the religion thread.5	who is the most goodlooking player in the world cup 2006?

He's gained a lot of weight bc he started eating tons of junk food & stopped exercising. He's also growing his hair long & it looks really bad on him. I loved the way he looked before - he was SO HOT when he was thinner & had short hair!\n\nHe knows I don't like his long hair. And he knows that he's gained weight & is unhappy about it. Yet he refuses to do anything to change it. He won't exercise & continues to eat tons of junk food.  And he won't cut his hair bc he likes it long. Yet he keeps whining & crying about how I'm not as attracted to him now as I used to be.\n\nIt's true that I used to be a lot more attracted to him than I am now. I don't rub this in his face; in fact I rarely mention it. But I guess he can sense it.\n\nHow can I get him to stop whining & complaining?  He could easily cut his hair, so isn't it his own fault? It's like if I didn't shower for a year & then cried when he said I smelled. You're not supposed to cry about it when it's your own fault, right? "... it's like if I didn't shower for a year & then cried when he said I smelled ..." - good one! LOL\n\nSeriously, your man may be facing serious issues right now that may have caused this 180 degree turn in his lifestyle.  Help him cope up with things rather than telling him to get a hair cut.\n\nOnce personal issues have been resolved, then he just might bounce back and look even hotter than before.\n\nDon't be the girl that dumped her man just because he wasn't cute anymore ;)7	what was the best album of last year (2005)?

The season finale is May 18th: It's entitled, "The Graduates".\n\nSUMMARY OF EPISODE 21 entitled “The Dawn Patrol”\nAired: 4/13/06:\n\nIt’s dinner time at the Cohen household. Ryan and Seth whisper conspiratorially about the wisdom of Seth lying to Summer about Brown. Seth still stands behind his decision, but not so much that he wants to tell his parents about it. Kirsten mentions that tickets for graduation have come in, and Ryan suggests giving his to the Nana since he won’t be needing them. Kirsten thinks Ryan should maybe invite his mom. Ryan thinks maybe he should avoid the topic and hope it just goes away.\n\nLater, Kirsten drops in on the pool house, apologizing for making Ryan uncomfortable. But Ryan is actually aware of the reality of the situation. This could be his last chance to see his mom. So it’s off to Albuquerque. \n\nWhen Marissa gets out of the shower the next morning, Volchok is waiting in her bedroom. And he’s ready to get her out of that robe and get it on. But that will have to wait, because Julie’s in the doorway and she already doesn’t like Volchok. It’s cool. Volchok doesn’t have to stick around for this. Julie tells Marissa no more Volchok, which is usually just the impetus Marissa needs to do something. If anything, Julie should’ve told Marissa to marry Volchok. Then she would’ve dumped him before lunch.\n\nAt harbor, Summer glumly shuffles around the student lounge. Seth watches her longingly from a distance, but doesn’t say anything. Taylor takes in the scene and then joins Summer at her table. But not matter what optimistic viewpoint Taylor has to share, Summer doesn’t want to hear it. She’d rather rant and rave about what Seth did to her. She can’t figure it out either, because she’s gotten even hotter this year and there’s no way a guy like Seth could walk away from her unless he was hiding something. And she’s determined to get to the bottom of it. \n\nMatt’s enjoying a morning cocktail at the yacht club when Sandy arrives for a meeting they’d planned. Matt hands Sandy a projection of calculated future earnings, with a little pain and suffering cash thrown in. Either Matt gets his money from Griffin or he tells the DA about the documents he has on Griffin. Sandy realizes he’s being blackmailed for the second time in a week.\n\nMarissa drops by Volchok’s ultra cool loft to hang out. At the same time, Ryan arrives at a small diner in Albuquerque looking for his mother. But her shift doesn’t start for a couple of hours. He’ll be back. Dawn’s young coworker, Chloe, is more than pleased to see somebody as cute as Ryan show up. Hopefully she has a troubled past, or else Ryan just won’t be into her. \n\nMeanwhile, in calculus class, Summer frantically tries to get Seth’s attention. She then bursts out laughing and explains to the annoyed teacher that Seth’s dead-on impersonation of the teacher’s penguin walk was cracking her up. The teacher gives them both weekend detention. In the hallway, Summer explains that she broke up with him, she has the power to revoke said breakup. Which she is doing until he can sufficiently explain what his deal is lately. She kisses him and then reports to Dr. Kim’s office. Seth is slightly confused, to say the least.\n\nAfter nightfall, Ryan heads back to the diner. He sees his mom slinging club sandwiches and flirting with a biker and decides he’d rather not go in. But when he turns to leave, Chloe asks where he’s going. And if he’s not going inside, would he like to go somewhere with her? Indeed he would. \n\nJust then, Marissa and Volchok are about to go downtown when there’s a knock at the door. From outside, Julie calls out for Marissa. Marissa hides as Volchok lets Julie in. Julie explains to Volchok that’s he just one in a long line of Marissa’s phases, and it’s inevitable that she’ll wise up one day and leave him in the dust. Marissa overhears the entire conversation.\n7	Help! I think my sub-machine gun got switched with my brother Bobo the clown's super-soaker water gun?

Im working in the cardiologist line, i can answer your questions.\nYou have to see a cardiologist for a check up, most probably they will do tests like ECG (record ur hearbeat rhythm), Treadmill Stress Test (to see if you have the irregular heart beat during exercise too), Echocardiography/ultrasound of the heart ( to see if you have abnormal valves) and 24 hours Holter (just a smalll device attached on ur body 24 hrs to record ur heartbeatfor a day).\n\nArrhytmias (irregular heart beat) can be caused by several factors, but you are a young boy; so most likely it will be caused by Premature Atrial Complexes or Premature Ventricular Complexes;which is also known as skipped heart beat\nIt has to do with the nerves in your heart muscle.\n\nIt could be inherited, trigger by stress, coffee and tea.

Bats emit sounds of frequencies around 35.0 kHz and use echolocation to find their prey. If a bat is moving at the speed of 12.0 m/s toward an insect at an air temperature of 20.0oC, (assume the insect and air are still)\n(a) What frequency is heard by the insect?\n(b) What frequency is heard by the bat from the reflected sound?\n(c) Would the speed of the bat affect the answers? This is what is called the Doppler Effect. All you really need to answer this question is a simple equation:\nf = f0 [(S +/- So)/(S -/+ Ss)]\nWhere f is the observed frequency, f0 is the frequency of the source, S is the speed of sound, So is the speed of the observer (+ if moving towards, - if away), and Ss is the speed of the source (- if moving towards, + if away).5	Where in Chicago can I find NFL Network on Thanksgiving?

Electrophoresis is the movement of an electrically charged substance under the influence of an electric field. This movement is due to the Lorentz force, which may be related to fundamental electrical properties of the body under study and the ambient electrical conditions by the equation given below. F is the Lorentz force, q is the charge carried by the body, E is the electric field [1]:\n\n. \nThe resulting electrophoretic migration is countered by forces of friction such that the rate of migration is constant in a constant and homogeneous electric field:\n\n \nWhere v is the velocity and f is the frictional coefficient.\n\n \nThe electrophoretic mobility μ is defined as followed.\n\n \nThe expression above applied only to ions at a concentration approaching 0 and in a non-conductive solvent. Polyionic molecules are surrounded by a cloud of counterions which alter the effective electric field applied on the ions to be separated. This render the previous expression a poor approximation of what really happens in an electrophoretic aparatus.\n\nThe mobility depends on both the particle properties (e.g., surface charge density and size) and solution properties (e.g., ionic strength, electric permittivity, and pH). For high ionic strengths, an approximate expression for the electrophoretic mobility is given by the Smoluchowski equation,\n\n, \nwhere ε is the dielectric constant of the liquid, ε0 is the permitivitty of free space, η is the viscosity of the liquid, and ζ is the zeta potential (i.e., surface potential) of the particle.4	Gmail html version won't open ...?

Just work backwards.  You need to work for 8 hours plus a 1/2 hour lunch (8 1/2 hours).\n\nYou need to leave by 2:30 p.m.  So when do you need to start work?  In other words, what time is 8 1/2 hours before 2:30 p.m.\n\nI'm not sure how versed you are at calculating time, but 2:30 is obviously 2 1/2 hours after noon.  Then you just need 6 more hours to account for.  6 hours before noon is 6 a.m.\n\nSo if you start work at 6:00 a.m. and leave at 2:30 p.m. you will have been at work for 8 1/2 hours.  That's 8 hours of working and 30 minutes (1/2 hour) for lunch.\n\nSo the answer is 0 minutes after 6 a.m.1	The boundry line graphed for the  linear inequality.

This represents the equation Y = 3. \n\nSince the inequality is strictly greater than, the line should be dashed (or dotted).  If it were >= then it would be a solid line.\n\nNow you test each half plane for a true value.  You need a point that is not contained on the line.  How about the origin (that is always the easiest point as long as it is not on the line itself).\n\nIf we plug the point (0,0) into the inequality you get the statement 0 > 3.  Is this a true statement?  No.  Therefore, you shade the half plane that does not contain the origin. If it were true, you would shade the half plane that contains the origin.\n\nHope this helps!2	told me everything known about Prince Harry?

All that are religious, plz don't take this the wrong way:\n\nThere's these two kids that go to sunday school, one of which who keeps falling asleep in class is sitting next to a retard. The teacher asks, "Who created heaven and earth?" the retard stabs the girl with his pencil. "God almighty!" yells the girl. "Very good!" says the teacher. The girl starts to snooze off again, the teacher asks, "Who died for our sins?" the boy stabs her with his pencil again, "Jesus Christ!" yelled the girl. "Very good." The girl goes off to sleep again, and the teacher asks, "What did Eve say to Adam after having their 26th kid?" the boy jabs her with the pencil again, and the girl yells, "If you jab that thing into me one more time, I swear I'll break it off!" Alright, let's revise this joke so we can relieve the good old laugh:\n\nLittle April was not the best student in Sunday school. \nUsually she slept through the class. \n\nOne day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?" \n\nWhen April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. "GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep. \n\nA while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep. \n\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. "What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR A$$!"2	Are you Horney?

How would I monitor a .txt log file in realtime with VB.net and return any new lines to my program? I will need the new lines of text as soon as they are added to the log file. I only need the new lines of text, not the entire file. Write a console application program in VB .NET to read the .txt file. Either delete the previous lines once you have read them, or have a counter to read only the new lines. Run it (F5).\n\nUse a timer with loops to control the granularity of time (depends on how fast you want to read the .txt). In that way, the new lines in .txt will keep getting read and processed the way you want it.3	Do you think the authors of the APA manual are being hypersensitive--or just plain wise about hidden or overt?

I'm in shape but if anyone has diet ideas, or programs that would be great. How long does this program take? Dude, it really doesn't take that long to get a six-pack.  I started working out in January, and have one now (after not working out for years).  Here's what you do:\n\nWork out 3 times a week, doing about 20 mins of cardio (rowing machine is great for abs, and upper body) and 40-70 minutes of weights (including abs).  Target each muscle group in your weight-training workout, doing about 3 sets of 9-12 reps on each muscle group except abs (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings, and calves).  Focussing on proper form instead of heavier weight, will cause you to grow and be cut a lot better and faster.\n\nFor abs specifically, use a decline-situp bench, and do as many twist crunches as you can (twist to one side at the top of each crunch, then twist to the other side, alternating).  Then use an ab roller, going straight, for as many reps as you can.  Next, do leg-lefts (keeping your legs straight) to target your lower abs.\n\nIn a few weeks, you should have a great 6-pack!  : )0	Who is christ?  , Jesus The Almighty God,King of Kings/Everything to me.God loves you and so do I.1	What is the difference between astrophysics and physics?

Why is it that we drive on parkaways but park on driveways? Why is it we bake cookies but cook bacon?2	Has anyone ever tried the GI (glycemic index) diet, and did it work? I was wondering if the GI diet works.  It looks like a very good diet to follow, but I don't want to start it if it does not give me results. The glycemic index is about foods high in carbohydrates. Foods high in fat or protein don't cause your blood glucose level to rise much.  The glycemic index is about the quality of the carbohydrates, not the quantity.  It lets you know what you should eat to keep you blood sugar more stable and body more healthy\n\nThe basic technique for eating the low GI way is simply a "this for that" approach - ie, swapping high GI carbs for low GI carbs. You don't need to count numbers or do any sort of mental arithmetic to make sure you are eating a healthy, low GI diet.\n\n    * Use breakfast cereals based on oats, barley and bran\n    * Use breads with wholegrains, stone-ground flour, sour dough\n    * Reduce the amount of potatoes you eat\n    * Enjoy all other types of fruit and vegetables\n    * Use Basmati or Doongara rice\n    * Enjoy pasta, noodles, quinoa\n    * Eat plenty of salad vegetables with a vinaigrette dressing\n.3	Who thinks President Bush is going to hell? Explain.... Yes, I do think he's going to hell. He violated the first commandment amoung other things. He said God appointed him as president, thats the kind of attitude our forefathers fought against and created this country. He's stolen from the American people, another commandment, he's lied, and accused others unjustly-another commandment. He says saddam should be prosecuted because he committed crimes against humanity? I think Bush should be prosecuted for the same thing! We went after hussien because he was easier to capture, and Bush had a personal vendetta against the Iraqui dictator. All he cares about are the rich, and could care less about the poor. He makes generalities that only the rich could live up to. The poor don't have money, how are they supposed live? The rich have money, and money makes George Bush's world go around.

I believe it's the most grueling race, but then consider the 800! That's going for twice as long at that "I'm going to die" speed. Anyone who has done both have an opinion? 400 over 800 any day for gut wrenching.\n\nOf the flat races, I would say its the hardest to run well, but I would put it behind the steeplechase and the 400 hurdles for being the toughest race in a meet.\n\nYou really can't run 800 at "I'm going to die" speed, of course if you go out the 200 like a fool, it may feel like you're doing it.1	Among the variety of humans, are there any different species?

Just wondering since they tend not to be so big on environmental issues...\n\n____________\nCarter, FYI the biological species concept definition of a species (the one you attempted to apply to humans) isn't actually used anywhere outside of a high school classroom.  Lions and tigers and interbreed (and produce fertile offspring), as can wolves and cyotes.  However, I don't think anyone would argue that lions and tigers are the same species.  You've arrived at the correct conclusion, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nOh, and Homo sapien is two words, although the proper name for modern humans is actually Homo sapien sapien.\n\n_________\n>>>"put it on the endangered species list" as in, genocide, \n\nWhat???  That doesn't make sense.  The endangered species list is a list of species we're protecting, not species we're trying to eliminate.  Putting a species on the endangered species list make it illegal to kill members of that species under most circumstances.\n\nTo answer you question about genocide, however, what stops genocide now?  I don't see where it would be any different if we were talking about a group that is officially a separate species.  Although, species being driven to extinction or "exterminated" is usually look upon as a *bad* thing, so I don't see where their being a separate species is an inherent justification for genocide, although I think it would be human nature to use it as such.\n\n\n_______\nThanks for pointing that out, Calimecita, I went back and capitalized the genus names.

Your kidneys are involved in both BP regulation (through water+salt retention) and also RBC production (through erythropoetin secretion).  Damage to the kidneys and/or stenosis of the arteries could do this.  It is also possible that she has something called polycythemia vera which is a pathological overproduction of RBCs (are you by any chance, Jewish?).  It can cause all of the symptoms you described except the high BP.  What else?  Pheochromocytoma (adrenaline-secreting tumor).  This can be checked with a blood or urine test for metanephrines (metabolites of adrenaline).  Other tumors of the adrenal glands (check aldosterone levels).  She may also have a transient cardiac arrythmia that comes, causes her symptoms, then goes away before she sees the doctor (so they wouldn't see it).  If none of these things are the case, it might be worthwhile to look at her brain with an MRI or CT scan.  She probably has increased intracranial pressure, but it's hard to say whether that was caused by the high BP or is *causing* the high BP.\n\nKind of tough to figure out what is wrong with her without seeing her in person....9	Why Im I called a racists just because i dont support ILLEGAL Immigration? So im a biggott just because i am a White Tax Paying CITIZEN of this Country and i care about the security of my Family..Dont even bother with that "wwe all are immigrants" spill.. Im not saying im against immigration.. its ILLEGAL that i have the problem with. Dont break the law and expect me to except you in our Country.. YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS>> I agree with you and most of the comments thus far.  Immigration is wonderful.  \n\nThere are laws, policies and procedures that govern Legal immigration.  Please, everyone who wants to come to this great land, come join the fun.  Just do it legally.\n\nThe laws may not be working perfectly.  The good news is that we have a way to change the laws legally.  As voters, we need to get to the pools and elect legislatures that will vote the way we want them to regardless of the subject.  The U.S. has one of the largest apathetic voter pools in the world, yet most will sit back and blame the government when they as a voter have done nothing to shape the government.\n\nWe all also need to return to 9th grade Civics class.  The president is ONE man.  The laws are written and approved by Congress before they reach his desk.  Congress also provides all the money and support for the presidents plans, yet the congressional candidiates receive the least amount of publicity.  They just get re-elected over and over until their term limit hits.  We need to clean house, and I mean clean "House", and "Senate" when I say that.\n\nOther than that I don't feel too strongly about the subject, maybe you are a racist, I don't know.6	how do I delete my yahoo answers account?

Religious writings?\nI have an opinion;  Whats yours? Morality can't be decided by popular opinion, because right is right and wrong is wrong.\n\nJust as we can't decide the sun should move west to east -- we think whatever we think, but that doesn't change reality.\n\nHarm is wrong. 'Cause suffering sucks.\n\nWhat people DO decide, sometimes sorta by popular opinion, are laws, which are another matter (it would be nice if law and morality were better matched).\n\nAlso, changes in the arbitrary aspects of ettiquette are determined by popular opinion.\n\nUntil whoever it was in a previous answer said it was a shame that rape is considered wrong (if I'm understanding that comment), that person had a pretty good handle on it.\n\nBut clearly rape, as a particularly devastating form of violence, is clearly wrong.\n\nBut the basic idea that morality has to do with what we are, the kind of critter we are, is right.\n\nThe problem with the 10 commandment is that several of them are arbitrary and even silly (most of the people who go on and on about them violate them every Sabbath by watching sports, for example), and the list as a whole leaves out a lot of things that are wrong.\n\nFor example, it's wrong to put another person in a double-bind or lose-lose situation, where no matter what they do they are hammered or punished.2	How do you spend your "just me" time? Do you get enough time for yourself?  my 'just me' time is usually when I'm reading for pleasure and whenever I'm on my bike during my days off, its the two things I enjoy, because I'm doing what I want for me not for anyone else, I think I do becasue if I get more I think I'll take for granted the time that I have and not enjoy it as much.

In the past two years, I've noticed that what used to be individual strands of floating matter in my eyes has turned into small clumps that now obstruct my vision! Looks like my vitreous jelly is liquifying and allowing individual strands to lock. Can this happen? Is there some other explanation? Most important, is there anything I can do to deal with this? It's important to get this checked out by an eye doctor. Sometimes people get floaters and it's not big deal, sometimes they go away, sometimes not, and it's not harmful. Other times, it can be a sign of something more serious. If you see any flashes of light, go immediately to a doctor (might even be cause to go to an emergency room) because that is a sign of a detaching retina (which can make you blind). In other cases, the floaters can be caused by something called neovascularization, which means new blood vessels forming in the eye. This really shouldn't happen, and can be corrected with lasers. I'm told it's not very uncomfortable. If you are diabetic,  this is a risk.\n\nSome causes of floaters that I am aware of: neovascularization causing distortions because the new blood vessels may cause a blind spot on the retina (laser treatment is a possibility); a small bleed in the vitreous that casts a shadow on the retina (may resolve in time, but needs to be checked still); the vitrous can pull away from the retina as a person ages, sometimes leaving a bit of debris, more common in people who are myopic (may resolve in time, not much to be done about it, but needs to be checked to make sure there isn't traction pulling on the retina, which can cause a detached retina).\n\nIn any case, just get it checked out right away. If there is a problem, it can probably be treated before it gets worse. Better sooner than later. Good luck.7	What do you think of when I say...? prehistoric.

Maybe someone might have a website that has quick food ideas... Well its good to eat a heavy brekfast..coz tht is the only meal which does not convert into fats.Try having eggs or oatmeat.Oatmeal contains carbs...which is very neccesary in a brekfast, gives u the enerjy to kickstart the day.Inbetween meals try having a protein shake or a protein bar.\nThanks,\nColin.8	is sandals an appropriate mothers day gift?

The reason ATP is the main energy source is because that's what happened through the process of evolution. And, as you know, there is no way to determine WHY something happened when it comes to evolution -- despite what the intelligent design advocates will tell you. All you can say, based on the ubiquitious nature of ATP's usage as the main energy carrier throughout most living organisms, is that ATP became the preferred energy carrier very early on in evolutionary time. Probably going back as far as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).2	Through the blood test  when I was pregnant found out that I have secendary stage of Syphilis? It scared me to death.

Most odds makers say it will be Indianapolis and Seattle.  However, I think Indy choked away their best chance under Peyton Manning last year.  Edgerrin James is no longer there and will be replaced by a rookie. I would say New England and Pittsburgh will play in the AFC championship, with New England getting back to the Super Bowl.  Seattle is a good bet in the NFC, but Carolina and Philly could also.  Many are saying that Dallas loaded for a run for it all this year, but I don't think they have the offensive line to keep a very immobile Drew Bledsoe off his back.  Sadly, I am a Dallas fan, but am trying to stay realistic here.2	What could cause recurring blisters in the exact same area? For about 6 years now, I get these blisters on left elbow in the exact same spot. They itch when they are forming and as they go away, but hurt to touch pretty much from begining to end. It is usually just one main blister, but sometimes there are several smaller ones surrounding it. They are red and raised but never fill with puss and burst. They just seem to dry up and go away. It is bothersome and of course looks odd. A few years back, it was suggested that it might be shingles, but there is none of that intense nerve pain I hear about and my parents can't agree on if I ever had chickenpox or not. As it heals it does flake some. A doctor that saw it at that stage told me it was fungal before running out of the room and on to the next patient. I just can't find anything that matches up. This sounds to me like a classic herpes virus infection.  These are very common.  Shingles is a form of herpes called herpes zoster but I think you have Herpes simplex.  The only way to know for sure is to get checked when you have a fresh outbreak.  A doctor can do a Tzanck preparation which is essentially a free test, they just take a sample and look under the microscope after the slide is stained.  If you want to get high tech, you can ask for a viral pcr test of a fresh lesion.  These are extremely accurate but a bit more expensive.  You may be able to go to a free STD clinic for their expertise.  Although this is not an STD problem, those doctors are pretty skilled with skin conditons.  Good Luck!9	why was FDR a good president?  Because he governed for the people.

What's their system for keeping track of the # of entries we've earned? Every time we get a 'Best Answer' and every time we invite someone to join Yahoo Messenger, we get an entry into the Yahoo World Cup draw - and we may win tickets to Germany & tickets to see the World Cup - but there doesn't seem to be a system to keep track of how many entries we've earned - and no indication of when the draw will be!

Okay - so b4 i posted this q!\n\nso basically I'm 17, I've never had a boyfriend but like a couple of months ago my friend told me that this guy who's kinda part of our group at school, really liked me. Before, I'd never really talked to him but for some reason I started to and i found that i actually quite liked him! Last week he asked me out and I said yes! Thing is now I don't really know what to do - Only time I've seen him really so far is at school - and there's always people around so it's really awkward! Also I'm kinda feeling like he likes me more than i like him! I do like him but at the moment I just really want to back out but I know I shouldn't! Any suggestions!!! \n\nAnd now - This is my situation \n\nStill havent proprly bin out with him but see him most days! he's kinda clingy - keeps saying sory fot stupid things etc - I've decided i can't go out with him any more - it's too hard - But i stil like him as a frend! hw do i let him dwn gently so we cld stil b  friends? First of all dating someone who has been your froiend is tough. As for how to let him down and still be friends....Dealing with heartbreak allways hurts someone and is very difficult to do, but if you do not be honest with him now...it will go on and on and the next thing you know..he will hear it from someone else and all of a sudden you are using him...at least that is what he will think. Just be upfront and honest with him. This way he knows the truth before someone else can distort it.\n\n\n\nCB6	who can give assistance with paying late lot rent in pinal county? assistance for arizona and pinal county with your bills Contact ur local red cross. in some situations they are able to loan u sum cash and provide further assistance.6	Is anyone awake out there?

You shouldnt hate love, its a very important aspect in life for everyone. Just because you dont like someone back it shouldnt make you hate the situation. My best friend is just like you. All the guys she knows have fallen for her and she started to hate love too. Eventually though, a guy came along who she liked back and now shes very happy. You're 15, you have a lot of life left to lead. When the right guy comes along, you'll like him back and be happy.

Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye. And "above" all these things [put on] "charity", which is the bond of perfectness. Because in order to forgive someone, you need to love them like Jesus does. I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but it is kinda hard to forgive someone whom you hate because that hatred will eat you up inside and make it virtually impossible to forgive that person.5	Where can I purchase a Bib number holder for triathalons?

This is a very good question, and the answer is real simple. The hard part is to find real opportunities. I did found some places that will help you find a for-real online job.\n\nFirst, search Craigslist and search for jobs under "Telecommuting". This way, only telecommuting jobs shows up. \n\nYou can also visit the other web sites I will list below. These websites will help you understand how to search for a job better.\n\nMy third suggestion? Be your own business! Market your skills for hire to companies. For example, if you are a writer, you can market your writings to magazines who are always looking for contributors. The best thing to do is to take a Learning Annex class that focus on marketing and developing yourself so you can work from home as a freelancer. If you don't live close to a Learning Annex, they have online classes that you can learn from. \n\nDon't be afraid to invest in yourself...\n\n... just make sure you don't invest money in looking for a connection. That's a waste of money and time.\n\nAnother bit of advice: check with the Better Business Beauru. But keep in mind: not all businesses registers with the BBB. I work with a client who have to pay a lot of money not only to get into the BBB, but it seems they want to make money from every angle, like if you have a website, you can't say you are a member of the BBB unless you register to be an online rep... even if you are not selling online.\n\nGood luck!1	What is sickle cell anemia?  The links will give you more information. Here are two  brief overviews:\n\n   Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, your red blood cells are flexible and round, and they move easily through your blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of your body. In people with sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregular-shaped blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells. Plus, they can get stuck when traveling through small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to certain parts of the body. This produces pain and can lead to serious complications.\n\nThere's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. However, treatments can relieve pain and prevent further problems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized primarily by chronic anemia and periodic episodes of pain. The underlying problem involves hemoglobin, a component of red blood cells. Hemoglobin molecules in each red blood cell carry oxygen from the lungs to body organs and tissues and bring carbon dioxide back to the lungs. \n\nIn sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin is defective. After hemoglobin molecules give up their oxygen, some may cluster together and form long, rod-like structures. These structures cause red blood cells to become stiff and assume a sickle shape. \n\nUnlike normal red cells, which are usually smooth and donut-shaped, sickled red cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels. Instead, they stack up and cause blockages that deprive organs and tissues of oxygen-carrying blood. This process produces periodic episodes of pain and ultimately can damage tissues and vital organs and lead to other serious medical problems. Normal red blood cells live about 120 days in the bloodstream, but sickled red cells die after about 10 to 20 days. Because they cannot be replaced fast enough, the blood is chronically short of red blood cells, a condition called anemia.3	Do u think using the Guillotine during the French Revolution helped?? why? how?

Also, please explain the bizare nature in which no one was allowed to suggest that a missile may have been the cause of the accident.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the Navy claims every bit of evidence was recovered, but if one were to see the reckage it is obviously missing an engine!  A whole engine couldn't be found?  Interesting, but not to mention the unidentified object picked up by radar heading toward the aircraft just before the explosion took place.

Ok, i feel gross asking this, but i want to know.....\nMy fiance is a clean person, takes a shower every single day, I have noticed like in the past 4-5 months that he has a bad odor down there(his penis). It is like a fishy odor.\nI know for sure 100% that he is not cheating and never has. Why does he smell like that? I mean he even smells like that after he takes a shower. \nHe didn't have this odor before. I don't know how to tell him. This is affecting our sex life too. What could be wrong? What is it from? \n\nPlease only serious answers!!!!!!!!!! No joking!!! As for approaching him, maybe the next time you go "down there", you can act kind of surprised, and say something like "Honey, I don't want to alarm you but you're smelly kind of strange down here. I'm only noticing because usually you smell so good. Maybe it's an infection or something".\nThat way it doesn't sound like you're disgusted, and he doesn't feel as embarassed.\nStuff like this happens.\nGood luck.8	What in your opinion is the best punishment for a rapist?

My husband quit smoking 5 years ago when we were dating. In March he started again. He's promised me a thousand times he going to quit but I see no effort on his part. I worry about his health, I hate the way he smells when he comes in. We have 2 young kids who need a father, and after losing 2 grandparents to lung cancer I'm scared. He blames me for his smoking which is bullsh*t. I stress him out, I didn't cook him breakfast so he couldn't wear his patch, his smoking is none of my business. I didn't marry a smoker, so why should I be stuck with him now? I feel he loves his cigarettes more than me and the kids. Is this wrong of me? It is his choice to buy cigarettes, light up and smoke them. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to do this. He keeps that smoking up and it will be the death of him yet. He is not immune to lung cancer or emphysema, these diseases are not prejudice.  He has his top priorites all wrong and he needs to decide what's more important...his smoking or his own health and his family.9	What is EARMARK used by congress?  Earmarks are funds assigned to certain projects that are attached to a completely unrelated appropriations bill. Say a bill is being passed that puts 25 more police on the streets in DC and say at the end of that bill there is a paragraph that says 1.5 billion dollars goes to the state of Alaska to build a bridge that goes to a city with only 50 ppl in it. (true recent earmark btw)\n\nWhen that bill passes, the earmark (funds) are approved.\n\nEarmarks increased from 1,300 in 1994 to 14,000 last year = $27 billion... so much for conservatives believing in small government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nThere are a few more facts worth noting:\n- Earmarks are also used to buy votes on legislation. Say a congressman is not wanting to approve a bill. They will approach that congressman and offer him x funds to be added to that bill as an earmark if he will vote for it. This happens a lot.\n- Bush recently asked congress to give him line item veto power which would allow him to cross out specific earmarks only without vetoeing the entire bill. That scares the heck out of me because I am sure he would only cross out democratic earmarks or use it to punish ppl who did not obey him.\n- There is a senator named Tom Coburn whom is notorious for bringing to the congressional floor earmarks. By him bringing them up for a vote, it 'outs' them.\n- This point is VERY IMPORTANT - whichever party has the majority controls what earmarks go into legislation. This means that right now democrats have been literally shut out by the republicans from getting funds to their democratic districts. It is my belief that this is Bush's way of punishing democratic districts.\n-The majority leader makes the final decision as to which earmarks are allowed... there is no vote on it... nothing. Most of the time, nobody even knows about them which means a lot of the time congressman will vote on a bill that has this pork attached to it and never know they are approving it.\n- There is currently a bi-partisan effort in washington to pass what is called the Pork-Barrel Reduction Act. This legislation doesn't stop earmarks but rather, it brings them out into the open.\nhttp://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/021406/news1.html\n\nCheck out this PBS Now video. It is short and you will learn a lot.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/now/politics/earmarksetc.html\n\nThere is a group called Citizens Against Government Waste that print annually print a book called "The Pig Book".

They found out I had no thyroid when I was two years old (extremly rare) because I was having seizures and my teeth weren't coming in.  Many, many tests were taken on me.. The Doctors called me a Miricle. The Doctors said I'd never have kids but somehow I was given the Miricle of children. So far in their twenties my kids seem to be alright but put weight on easy. They have been tested. I wonder if it is possible for them or their children to have problems down the line. Only 2% of cases of congenital hypothyroidism are hereditary, so it is unlikely that your grandchildren will have any problems.  Even if they do, *all* newborns in the U.S. are tested for this before they leave the hospital--so it would be discovered right away.  As long as they took their synthroid, they would be normal kids and grow up to be normal adults.7	What is POD seating at a circus.? The circus has POD seating on the floor at eye level.

Okay for guys, how do you act when you like a girl?  And for girls, how can you tell that a guy likes you?  and when you know for sure that he likes you, what do you do? Hi,\nThat isnt a dumb question. \nWell there are basically 3 types of boys. The 1st type is the shy one. If that kind of boy likes a girl, he would shy away from her and become tongue-tied and uncomfortable in her presence. Otherwise, he could be quite outspoken and garrulous.\nThe 2nd type is the guy who tries to impress. The majority of boys belong to this class. This type of boy will start showing off in front of the girl he likes. He could make jokes or show off his biceps or his brains, whichever be his strength.\nThe 3rd type of guy is the brat. There is a saying that a boy teases and bothers you only because he likes you. This is pretty true, but it isnt always true. A guy who keeps bugging you could like you, or he could be doing it just for fun.\nIt isnt neccessary that a boy would strictly adhere to any one of the 3 classes. Usually, it is a mixture of the 3 classes. That is just 1 factor which makes love so unpredictable.\n\nWhen I like a girl, I usually get a little shy and I might show off just a little bit. You just have to have a good intuition. Take a look at his body language, his eye contact, his rate of breathing etc etc. Usually, I can tell if a girl likes me. You just have to keep your senses open.\n\nWhen you know for sure that he likes you, then you could show your interest in him too, through subtle gestures and body language, and then wait for him to ask you out. Or you could make the move yourself and ask him out. It is all up to you.7	how many actor's come from the state of missouri?  Check out this link.

We all know about Asian ancient martial arts. But what about europe in the mediaval age...Do knights and other warriors have created or documented fighting moves or their very own martial arts discipline? Sort of. European culture is quite a bit different than Asian culture, so they aren't even remotely similar, BUT...\n\nEuropan fencing, boxing, and wrestling are all forms of Martial Arts. Martial = fighting and Art = something stylized and learned.\n\nAnd in Scottland, the Scottish Highland Dancing was originally developed for the Scottish wariors to improve balance and coordination.\n\nAnd I've seen a few books from Europe on sword fighting written for the slightly richer than average citezen. It was pretty stylized, and they remind me a lot of the books I've read on Kung Fu in modern days.1	what is rock n roll? math work with pizzazz ?4	Can any1 help me get the download for drag racer v3 ive tried the one answer i saw but it didnt. thank you:)?  http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/dragracerv3 or www.dragraceronline.net\n\nWas just there.

Isn't it only worth what people are willing to pay for it? Yes they are rare, but you can't survive on them. So if it came down to Diamonds & Gold OR being able to eat which one would you spend your last money on if you knew that there wasn't going to be any more food around for MONTHS? Its expensive because its rare and elegant. Something that is rare is not as abundant as a simple rock. In economic terminology, just imagine too many people chasing fewer and fewer goods. So obviously the demand increases and if deman increases, prices go up. If diamonds and gold are as abundant like sand and dust, i bet you could have gotten diamonds and gold for free. \nBut I agree with you in food and gold comparision. Food is our NEED and gold is our WANT.3	I'm looking for sayings. Any good sayings like this one....? ...smile it makes people wonder what your up to.

The traditional way for 3 names is: first name initial is smaller, last name initial is large, middle name initial is smaller.  What is the proper monogram etiquette for a person who has 2 middle names?  Do you leave out the 2nd middle name initial? This is a question that will come up more and more often when the new generation of younguns come of age.  I have a grandaughter with 2 middle names and a nephew with 3 middle names.  I could get on a soap box about the indicisive nature of young people these days, but I will hold my tongue.  \n\nI think the traditional monogram is here to stay for now, and it only allows for 3 letters.  Some folks will say choose the "first" middle name, but it is my opinion that the person should be  able to choose his/her on monogram.  First name, last name, middle name of choice.  \n\nOf course, there are a number of people who do not go by their first name at all.  That opens up a whole nuther can of worms!  \n\nIt is just a monogram.  Do what makes you happy.

It should be banned. I have seen police officers smoking while driving. taxi drivers and bus drivers. They should be fined and banned from driving for 3 months minimum. smoking is a distraction. being distracted while driving can kill.

Father rarely paid c.s. Now son lives with father does he still owe me back pay? My son was 12 and went to live with his father.I didnt want to let him go but i felt sorry for him because he never had his dad in his life and missed out on all the father/son stuff...I now know it was a big mistake but my son used to cry because he wanted to see his dad. For 2 years i said no. But later i was talking to his teacher about it and she said i should let him go or he would resent me later.....So to make a long story short his father rarely paid any of his child support. It didnt matter how many times my sons father stood him up or didnt send gifts he always acted like his Dad hung the moon. In the end his father was owing me like 10 grand in child support. When i finally decided to let him go about a year ago i had to sign custody over to his dad. We agreed that i wouldnt pay child support since he almost never (400 bucks in 11yrs.)paid. But now 1yr later he wants child support from me-thats fine i dont mind paying. But how can i get my past due c.s. he owes me or does he If he had a court order to pay support he still owes it to you. It's going to be very hard for him to get support from him. You have to make A LOT more money than he does for that to happen. I would get an attorney.. and discuss it with him.. The support covers the expenses that were involved when you had custody. I would not give him child support...let him know how it feels. If you go to court, more than likely the judge if he wants you to pay (and that's doubtful) will offset your support with what he owes you..Which means if you are ordered to pay 1,000.00 per month, you would not owe for 10 months..However, talking to an attorney would be your best bet...HE STILL owes you back support and unless you are making more than him, chances are he won't get support.

The Celeron family complements Intel's higher-performance (and more expensive) Pentium CPUs family. Introduced in April 1998, the first Celeron was based on the Pentium II core. Later versions were based on the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Pentium M. These processors are suitable for most applications, but their performance is somewhat limited when it comes at running intense applications, such as cutting edge games or graphical modeling programs, especially when compared to that of their high-end counterparts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe new chip family, which includes the processor formerly known by the code name Banias, was designed to help manufacturers build notebooks that use less power and offer extended battery life, along with better wireless networking capabilities. Instead of just giving Banias a variation on the company's well-known Pentium moniker, Intel decided to set the family of chips apart with a completely new name. A few insiders at Intel had been jokingly referring to the Banias chip as Mobilium, but Intel will call the new chip itself Pentium-M. Intel says the Centrino name, and a new logo that goes with it, suggest flight and mobility. The name is a blend of the words "center" and "neutrino," the company said. (A Google search on "centrino" also reveals the term to be a common one in Italian embroidery circles.) "The Centrino brand signifies a new generation of mobile PCs that will change where and how people compute," Pam Pollace, vice president and director of Intel's corporate marketing group, said in a statement. The Centrino family will also include chipsets, which handle data inside a PC, and wireless radio modules designed to allow new notebooks to use 802.11 wireless networking.9	Can a contract signed in jail be legal and binding i/e quick claim to transfer property ? this question has to do with property example: being of sound mind and body ? I was in jail and forced to quick claim my 200,000 $ property to another famialy member to save said property from being sold for back tax's ? It is called a quit claim for one thing, and if they were going to sieze it they would have already. You should have a lawyer if you were in jail so ask them. They can't say anything to anyone about it and they will have to bring you the papers anyway if you are still in jail.6	Whats the total property value of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachan in Indian Rupees?

You have to divide the salary by the number of hours worked to earn it. That's the only way!\n\nIf you get paid $4000 a month and you work 40 hours a week you have worked an AVERAGE of 173.33 hours per month (40 hours/week times 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months), depending on your exact pay period. Thus you would be making  a little more than $23 an hour.\n\nThe 2080 quoted by Zandelia is just 40 hours per week times 52 weeks in a year or the number of hours worked in a standard year. However, as other people pointed out, you might work more than 40 hours weekly on salary... or LESS. What ever the number of hours worked in a pay period, divide the pay for that  period by the hours to get the answer!1	Thermoregulatory control mechanisms in the elderly?

My teeth are a little yellow and i was wondering did anyone know of  a good tooth whitening toothpaste that you can buy in the uk in a shop such as boots? Whitening toothpastes only work up to a point (usually only remove surface stains, and only partially because they work by abrasion). If you really want to whiten your teeth, get some sort of tooth whitening product, or better yet, go see you dentist.\n\nOne additional note on tooth whitening products. The main active ingredient in them is hydrogen peroxide, the maximum level of which is regulated in the EU. The problem is that in the case of cosmetics products (basically anything you can buy in a regular shop) the maximum level allowed is not enough to actually whiten teeth. So whatever you find on shop shelves either doesn't really work, or if it does, it's not entirely legal. Regulations in the US are different and peroxide levels in products there are much higher.3	Any websites that might be helpful for secondary school teens?  www.ajkids.com4	WHAT'S THE BEST (and least expensive) WAY TO NETWORK A HARD DRIVE IN SOHO ENVIRONMENT?

I have contacts with many garments factory owners who are ready to supply big orders at very competetive prices. Can someone tell me how I go about on this to find a buyer in the USA? i live in minneapolis. I will be the middle man in all these and for that do I need to register a business name or what do I have to do? Thanks for the help. You're going to want to handle a few things here.  You've got to establish yourself legally as a distributor, which probably involves incorporating or at least setting up an LLC.  (You don't want the personal risk of a shipment going south, do you?)  \n\nSecond, you're going to want to establish distribution fulfillment (how long does it take to get things here, what choices do clients have, what terms are you willing to provide, what kind of shipping insurance, etc. are you putting together to make this a predictable process?)\n\nNext, you're going to want to establish a business presence.  The large retail organization will have buyers: professionals that choose what's going to be in a certain season or promotion's lineup.  You've got to get them the goods, interface with them, and meet their expectations.\n\nI'd recommend one general book for your process: The New Conceptual Selling.  You're going to want to manage client expectations and go through a fact-finding process with them that's going to match their win with your ability to fulfill it.  \n\nI'd also recommend that you meet one or two buyers before investing too much into the business.  You can explain your position and get an actual buyer to teach you at least a few pointers.  Once you get those pointers down, you will be well-enough grounded to actually start the conceptual sales cycle with potential clients.\n\nWhen you're finally to this point, you're going to buy a list of buyers (infousa.com is a reputable source) and prospect them in a regular, cyclical way.  Prospecting Your Way to Sales Success by Bill Good is a great approach to this.  (Kind of a cheesy book, but still the best one I've found out there.)  \n\nThis is probably a very good business for you to get into if you have reliable sources and know what they can safely deliver for you.  Be sure you are delivering what you're selling, and you'll build a business for yourself.\n\nOne alternative approach you can take is to do the same thing with designers (usually out of New York).  These guys are going to drive the biggest retail companies' buy decisions.  For these, you'd position yourself as a direct-factory resource for whatever they're designing.  They'll have exacting standards of quality, materials, textile treatments, delivery times, sizes, etc.  They'd probably be a much more steady source of revenue for you, once you establish yourself with them.\n\nGood luck!5	how many HOF won Rookie of the year in each league?

Please your honest opions, I keep reading answers, like doctors and drug companies are in this together.  Just want money, not interested in healing the person?? Gosh I never had this thoughts till reading so many negative responses here on Yahoo.  Do I have to much faith, in the Health Care System?? I mean before vaccines and antiobiotcs, people died by the millions from diseases and infections. Hi, Registered Nurse here; I have also noticed some of the negative response to health care here on Yahoo.  I don't think our health care system is near what it should be.  But not for a minutes do I believe physicians and pharmaceutical companions are conspiring against the people.  Medical school is far to hard, not to be dedicated to the patient.  I've further seen people write that vaccines are not necessary, well we can all believe as we want.  But I agree vaccines, antibiotics, advancement in almost all fields of health care have greatly benefited the human race.  Yes people still die, and yes, Doctors, Nurses, and the entire health care team do make mistakes for we are only human, and that cannot be factored out, as hard as everyone tries, and the most dedicated do make mistakes.  And even one mistake in regards to someones life and health is to many.  But unfortunately The Health Care System is made up of humans, and to be human is to error.

So why does this island look tropical if it is only  and only 1000 miles east of South Carolina.I know it is north of the Tropic of Cancer.\nLikewise, why does northeastern US run parallel to southern Europe but the former is remarkedly colder in temperature? Bermuda is a tropical island because of it's climate.  To consider something as "tropical" doesn't necessarily depend on how far it's located from the tropics itself.\n\nThe different in temperature across the Atlantic is determined by the current in the Northern Atlantic.  It runs clockwise from the coast of Africa, to the Caribbean, up the East Coast of the US, and towards Western Europe.  Latitude wise, England is farther north than New England, but temperatures are similar due to the climate brought upon by the Atlantic current.  Once the current heads south towards southern Europe, it starts to cool.  Think of the same situation for the West Coast of the US, which is cooler on average than the Philippines or Japan across the Pacific.8	Why not meet a mate at church - they will be a better life partner?

She was George Pattons Jr. sister. Her really name was Anne but she went by Nita. 1887\n\n"In this setting, at Lake Vineyard, Mama and Papa had a son on November 11, 1885. They named him George Smith Patton, Jr., after his father and grandfather. A sickly infant whose nurse, Mary Scally, feared he would die in the first few months, he grew into a strong and healthy, exuberant child. \n\nSoon after his birth, the Pattons moved to Los Angeles, twelve miles to the southwest, so that Papa could be closer to his work. Two years later, they had a daughter, whom they christened Anne and who came to be known as Nita or Anita. Although they lived in town, they spent much time at Lake Vineyard, and Georgie and Nita had the impression of growing up there in the country. "9	Collage Kids please answer? Why don't you help us?

I like this guy that I work with, but I'm getting really mixed messages. For example, I've noticed that he walks away whenever I walk up to wherever he happenes to be standing.. I thought he was quiet at work, but I came out of the break room early yesterday and he was standing with the other workers talking to them.. as I walked up, he walked away!\nThe few times I talk to him, he smiles and looks embarrased, but why does he walk away?\nI'm getting mixed messages... For example - when I first come into work, he'll stop whatever he's doing and walk my way to say hello (though I've seen him do this for another girl, too)..  But whenever I go up to him to ask him a work related question, he'll answer me while walking away...  I've invited him out to hang out with us, and he smiled and said that I should give him more notice and that next time he'll come out with us.. Not a yes, but not a no..\n\nwhat the hell is up with this guy? should I even bother persuing this? You could be making yourself too obviously interested for his comfort.  You know, I'm sure, how workplace rumors can crush a persons reputation and perhaps he's trying to avoid anyone witnessing anything that will look bad for the both of you in the long run.2	my left is losing vision quickly. blurring,blurred,silver  brigh sight,vision before blurree vidion?  same with me but its my right eye.

M, N>0 center is at orignin,major axis is 18 minor axis is 6  the way i learned it the standard form of an equation of an ellipse is x^2/a^2 + Y^2/b^2=1\n\nSince x^2 is before y^2 in this problem, the ellipse is horizontal, meaning the major axis is going horizontally. One of the rules of ellipses states that the length of the major axis is 2a units, and the length of the minor axis is 2b units.  therefore, a=9, and b=3 so the equation is x^2/9^2 + y^2/3^2 =14	what is the operating system of imac?

She invited me in, peeled my dirty clothes off, walked me to her bathroom and helped me slip into the candle lit bubble bath she had made for me.\n\nShe then brought me a beer, then minutes later came into the room naked, carrying a plate with an incredible steak meal she had just made for me.  She sat near the bath-tub, cut my meal for me and fed me a fork-full at a time.  She was a model from New York, and between her beauty, her style, her grace and her generosity she burned that moment in to my mind, and it will be there forever. \n\nThink about it, candle lit bubble bath, a cold beer, a beautiful woman and a great meal.

Is that realy , what happend in the seventies ? I mean the agents in this movie kill , distroy , move from a country to another ; and no one care about them! Operation Wrath of God and Operation Spring of Youth\n\nGolda Meir and the Israeli Defense Committee made a decision secretly authorizing the Mossad to track down and eliminate those responsible for the Munich massacre [25]. To this end the Mossad set up a number of special teams to locate and eliminate these terrorists, aided by the agency's stations in Europe [26].\n\nThe Israeli mission later became known as Operation Wrath of God or Mivtza Elohim[27]. Reeve quotes General Aharon Yariv — who, he writes, was the general overseer of the operation — as stating that after Munich the Israeli government felt it had no alternative but to exact justice.\n\n    We had no choice. We had to make them stop, and there was no other way ... we are not very proud about it. But it was a question of sheer necessity. We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye ... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I’m very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? Will it bring us nearer to peace? Will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don’t think it will. But in the case of Black September we had no other choice and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital? It was.[28]\n\nBenny Morris writes that, using information from "turned" PLO personnel and friendly European intelligence services, the Mossad compiled its target list, placing at the top Wael 'Aadel Zwaiter, a suspected member of Black September and the official PLO representative in Italy, who was shot and killed on October 16. Abu Iyad, the PLO's deputy-chief and chief of intelligence until his death at the hands of an Abu Nidal operative in 1991, later claimed that Zwaiter was not connected to Black September and had "fiercely opposed ... all forms of terrorism" (Abu Iyad 1983). Zwaiter's death was followed by non-fatal letter bomb attacks on PLO representatives in Algeria and Libya, on Palestinians in Bonn and Copenhagen, and on a Red Cross representative in Stockholm, writes Morris.\n\nOn December 8, the PLO's representative in Paris, Mohammad Hamshari was killed by a radio-detonated bomb under his desk. Over the next three months, writes Morris, four PLO, PFLP, and PFLP-GC operatives were killed in Cyprus, Greece, and Paris.\n\nOn April 9, 1973, Israel launched Operation Spring of Youth, a joint Mossad-IDF operation in Beirut. The targets were Mohammad Yusuf al-Najjar (Abu Yusuf), head of Fatah's intelligence arm, which ran Black September, according to Morris; Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's so-called Western Sector, which controlled PLO action inside Israel; and Kamal Nassir, the PLO spokesman. A group of Sayeret commandos were taken in nine missile boats and a small fleet of patrol boats to a deserted Lebanese beach, before driving in two cars to downtown Beirut, where they killed Najjar, Adwan and Nassir. Two further detachments of commandos blew up the PFLP's headquarters in Beirut and a Fatah explosives plant. The leader of the commando team that conducted the operations was Ehud Barak.\n\nOn June 28, 1973, the Algerian-born director of operations for Black September in Europe, Mohammad Boudia, was killed by a car bomb in Paris.\n\nOn July 21, 1973, in the so-called Lillehammer affair, a team of Mossad agents killed Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan man unrelated to the Munich attack, in Lillehammer, Norway, after an informant mistakenly said Bouchiki was Ali Hassan Salameh, the head of Force 17 and a Black September operative. Five Mossad agents, including two women, were captured by the Norwegian authorities, while others managed to slip away[29]. The five were convicted of the killing and imprisoned, but were released and returned to Israel in 1975.\n\nThe Mossad later found Ali Hassan Salameh in Be2	Do you feel very uncomfortable by experiecing every thing more than ones? Per example if i see the furniture in the same place\ni get sick . if i stay i the same job for long time every thing stars to out of place and i get sick than i quit that very moment. well now i can control it to a point but i can't be quiting my jobs all the time. You might have a bipolar disorder or perhaps even something similar to an obsessive compulsive disorder or phobia against stagnation, or things remaining the same.\n\nMy advice, not including therapy and/or meds, would be to change the little things that you can as often as you can. Wear your hair differently as your mood strikes. Change your clothes often if necessary.\n\nRather than move your furniture around all the time, get some decorative slip covers for your chairs and couch and such. Get a couple different styles and change them often but only move your furniture once in a while. This will save your furniture and your back.\n\nRegarding your job, try to change the things that you can without threatening your job security. If you have your own work space, change the decor as you see fit. Change the flowers, change the pictures that you have. If you've got kids, hang their drawings but change them up. Kids are always making new things.\n\nIn other words, find a way to change that things that you can without having to give up things that you work hard for.  See the big picture of your disorder and conquer it. Don't concentrate on controlling your disorder, but rather controlling yourself. It may seem like a technicality, but it helps some people.2	How do you cleanse your system? I saw someone mention you need to do this every three months.?

When the owner, by chance found the culprit, he admitted the wrong doing to the police but couldn't/ wouldn't pay for the damage. The police say they can't do anything. The insurance co says that to process the claim for the damage would make it neccessary to raise their premiums. What would happen if YOU had been the "fence breaker"? Jail? Civil suit for damages?

Should I just call my friend and have them do it for me or is it pretty easy? The best thing is to get the GIMP.  It's a free image manipulation package that's easily as easy to use as Photoshop and best of all, it's free and installs easily without serials or keys.\n\nIf you must install and use that downloaded Photoshop, then I really can't help much with the downladed version as I have no idea what was downloaded (could be anything).  Plus, when you download stuff off Limewire, it could be the real thing or it could be a virus.\n\nThe GIMP is really a far safer approach.  You'll need to download two installer packages GTK 2 Runtime and The GIMP.  After that, install these two files and you're all set.  The GIMP does pretty much everything that Photoshop can do, in case you were wondering.3	What is the scientific name of asian elephant?

The twelve ghosts which make up the Black Zodiac all have their own unique back story, and while these were not described in the film, the production and make-up teams used them as guidelines. All the ghosts were contained in glass prisons, and were caught with the aid of the psychic Rafkin, who could locate them, and on the behalf of Cyrus.\n\n1. The First Born Son (played by Mikhael Speidel)\n\nThe First Born Son is the ghost of a little boy called Billy Michaels, who was obsessed with cowboy films. Not heeding his parents' advice, he played Cowboys and Indians with a real bow and arrow, and the arrow went straight through his forehead.\n\n2. The Torso (played by Daniel Wesley)\n\nThe Torso is the ghost of a gambler called Jimmy Gambino. Losing everything in a poker game, he tried to welch on his bet and escape. The mob, which he owed money to, caught up with Gambino and cut him into several pieces, wrapping them in cellophane and dumping the corpse.\n\n3. The Bound Woman (played by Laura Mennel)\n\nThe Bound Woman was a cheerleader, who was strangled after a high school prom after cheating on her boyfriend. She was strangled by him, and was later found buried on the football field.\n\n4. The Withered Lover (played by Kathryn Anderson)\n\nThe Withered Lover is Jean Kriticos, the wife of Arthur. She died in the freak house fire while trying to rescue her children.\n\n5. The Torn Prince (played by Craig Olejnik)\n\nThe Torn Prince is the ghost of Royce Clayton, who was a baseball star. He challenged a greaser to a drag race and was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\n6. The Angry Princess (played by Shawna Loyer)\n\nThe Angry Princess is Dana Newman, who constantly tried achieving perfection with her looks, despite being beautiful. She gave up eventually and slit her own wrists. She was found with dozens of self-inflicted gashes on her. The movie suggests that she killed herself for another reason (In the scene when she appears in the bathroom, you see the phrase "I'm sorry" on the floor in blood). This, however, was probably there to add more drama to the scene and not true.\n\n7. The Pilgrimess (played by Xantha Radley)\n\nThe Pilgrimess is the ghost of Isabella Smith, an English woman who travelled across the Atlantic and settled in New England. She was a separatist, and this isolated her from the other townsfolk. She was found guilty of witchcraft, and put to death in the stocks (pillory).\n\n8. & 9. The Great Child and The Dire Mother (played by C. Ernst Harth and Laurie Soper)\n\nThe Dire Mother is the ghost of Margaret Shelburne, who was imprisoned by a group of lumberjacks, forced to live in a cage as a form of entertainment, due to her being only three feet tall. She had a child with one of the lumberjacks, a son Harold who weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nHarold was spoiled by his mother, who raised him to be her protector and to exact revenge on the lumberjacks. Harold took up his father's axe, and was capable of chopping down massive redwoods single-handedly. Eventually he turned the axe on the other lumberjacks, and both he and his mother were killed by a frenzied mob.\n\n10. The Hammer (played by Herbert Duncanson)\n\nThe Hammer is the ghost of a blacksmith, George Markley, who lived in a small town in the 1890s. He was driven out of town after wrongfully being accused of stealing. Enraged, he tracked down the people responsible and hammered them to death. The other townsfolk captured him, and they drove large nails into his body and cut off his hands.\n\n11. The Jackal (played by Shane Wyler)\n\nThe Jackal is Ryan Kuhn, a psychotic mental patient with a penchant for attacking women. He was permanently in a straitjacket, and had a metal cage locked around his head. After years of this, he had grown deformed, and reviled human contact. He was the only victim of a fire that broke out in the asylum; he apparently ran into the flames rather than let anyone touch him.\n\n12.

There are several theories put forward by which a local anesthetic  agent works. The commonly accepted theory is the "Specific Receptor Theory".. The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section.3	bolywood actor Sharukh khan's wife name? he is great inidan actro , name of his wife.

Since he has e-mailed me and he said that he has thought about me alot since he left and misses me.  Not sure what to do about it. I am very happy to hear this because i know I'm in love with him i just know he is going thru a seperation/divorce.  Stupid question but do you think he has strong feelings for me?   I don't know how to seperate friendship vs love in this situation ?? Whew, tangled web...first, he is going through a separation with his wife and if you care about him at all, you will be his friend and tell him you are there for him in that capacity but don't want to complicate his ability to sort through by you getting involved on top of it.  You are growing more fond as you daydream about him, because that is always the case, "absence makes the heart grow fonder" and that is true, we fantasize about the coulda, woulda, shoulda's in our lives. The best thing you can do is keep going in your world and though you keep a special place in your heart for him, wish him and his family the very best.  If when he works through everything and time goes by, it all works between the two of you, that will be glorious and at least you will know you weren't the reason for his marriage's failure.

Some questions, no matter how simple, don't have one knowable answer. Though a number of "explanations" exist for this custom, nothing points to any one of them being its origin. \n\nCommon among these explanations are: \n\n\nAt one time people believed a man's soul could be inadvertently thrust from his body by an explosive sneeze, thus "Bless you!" was a protective oath uttered to safeguard the temporarily expelled and vulnerable soul from being snatched up by Satan (who was always lurking nearby). The purpose of the oath was to cast a temporary shield over the flung-out soul which would protect it just long enough to regain the protection of the corporeal body. \n\nConversely, the sneeze itself was the expulsion of a demon or evil spirit which had taken up residence in a person. Therefore, although the "Bless you!" was again a protective charm meant to protect the sneezer from evil, in this version it was meant to ward off the re-entry of an evil spirit which a tormented soul had just rid itself of. \n\nThe heart was believed to momentarily stop during a sneeze (it doesn't), thus the "Bless you!" was uttered either as a supplication for life to return or as a congratulation upon its successful restart. \n\nOthers claim an association of the practice with particular dire diseases (most often the bubonic plague, or "Black Death," as it is sometimes known). They say an infected person's sneeze was sure sign he'd soon be pushing up daisies, thus the "Bless you!" was intended as a benediction to the nearly-departed, a way of commending his soul to the care of God now that he was beyond the help of anything in the mortal world. \n\nYet other folks echo the theme of other superstitions about sneezes, that these expulsions are either in themselves lucky or foretell good fortune coming the sneezer's way. For them, the "Bless you!" is a recognition of incoming good luck, possibly even an attempt on the blesser's part to attract a bit of it to himself. \n\nFinally, some see the sneeze as a blessing bestowed by the sneezer upon the sneezed-upon. Answering a sneeze with "Bless you!" is seen as nothing more remarkable than replying "Good morning!" to the person who had just greeted you with the same phrase.8	misssmoothforever.......................? who thinks she should shave her head Now, now, Bubbles.

The sockets are different. (for more info see the wikipedia link below.)  If you have a Pentium M, then you have a motherboard with a cpu socket 479.  That socket can hold the following: \n\nIntel Pentium M (900 MHz - 2.267 GHz)\nIntel Celeron M (800 MHz - 1.733 GHz)\nIntel Core Duo (1.667 - 2.167 GHz)\nIntel Core Solo (1.667 GHz)\nVIA C7-M (1,5 GHz and 1,8 GHz)\n\nI think that the Core Duo T2700 (2.33 GHz, 31 W, FSB 667 MHz, dual-core) would be the best you can get.

She is living in Canada i want her to come over to the uk and live with me we want to get marred.what do i need to do to get her over hear and to stay She would need to apply for a spouse visa, which would be valid for two years. At the end of that time, if you are still together and she hasn't needed any form of public assistance (benefits, council housing, etc) then she should get settlement here.\n\nIf your beloved is legally resident in Canada, and you can show that you can accommodate her, etc, you'll probably be OK. If she's there illegally, you may have problems! If she's there on a temporary basis, they'll treat her as if she's applying from Russia, ie skeptically, I should think.\n\nAnyway, I think she could apply at the British High Commission in Canada, she'll probably be called there for an interview, where they'll look at her documentation, and question her about the nature of her relationship with you.\n\nLook, I'm not an immigration advisor, so check out the Home Office website www.homeoffice.gov.uk, and get some free advice from somewhere like a CAB or Law Centre - it's really important not to get these things wrong, and the law is changing all the time.\n\nBy the way, if she comes here on some other visa, eg tourist visa, she will NOT be allowed to marry you here. So check it all out first.\n\nGood luck!2	Is celibacy unhealthy? If you go your whole life without sex,could there be any harmful effects on your health? Many people practice celibacy . Calibacy doesn't mean your a virgin . It is total choice and noone should preasure you into it . I firmly believe that everyone should practice it until they are married due to the fact that it would cut back teen pregnacie and unwanted pregnacie in and across the world . Celibacy is also the only way not to contract any type of sexual deiseases. Be true to your self and in knowing that it is a choice  and a safe choice . I know i would if someone would have told me about it when I was younger .9	What's a hate crime? This term, "hate crime," refers to a violent crime inspired by racially-charged hatred.  As a result, offenders can be given heavier sentences for the racial aspect of the said crime.  Here's my question:  what kind of violent crime ISN'T "hateful"?  Since when did someone commit a violent act out of love?  Is this just a tactic used by minority groups to serve their own interests?  Like it or not, people have the RIGHT to be racist, and until they commit a crime as a result of that racism, they can not be charged as criminals.  Therefore, racial motivation should play no role in the sentencing of the convict as racism alone is not illegal, but rather, only the violent acts that may follow are such.  You know where I stand at this point, now I want to hear what YOU think about these "hate crimes." I Believe that when a crime is committed because of a racial difference, then of course the offenders hatred should be brought to light. And Yes, violent crimes can be committed out of "love". I'm sure you've heard about stalking. In some cases stalkers have been known to kill or attempt to kill their prey.They do it because they can't have that person, so they kill them  or attempt to kill them so no one else can have them. I used to live in the Mid-South, near a Klan ridden town. It was shameful watching the havoc they wreaked on innocent people.Hate crimes have been around since the Germans tortured the Jews, it's nothing new. If you hate someone, hate them for what they have done, not for their color or nationality.4	Why is my computer erratically losing connection with my wireless router, it works with my 2nd computer? The connection repair option on Windows XP sometimes works, sometimes not. My router is Linksys, about 2 years old. I have run all of my anti-virus, anti spyware/adware, ClamWin and Norton... I have run defrag and diskchk. I have rebooted several times. The connection to the router ranges from 54mbs, down to 5mbs. The signal quality ranges from excellent down to very low. And the status is connected or not. I have not been able to isolate the specific problem as to hardware feature or software feature.

She sounds very self-centered. Just let her know how you feel and let her know that you believe friendship is base on communication from both sides. If she still doesn't change, next time when she start whining just tell her you have to go and you are busy.0	who invented to use Last names ???  they got invented as the first names became more used and used.

For a 16 year old you are off to a good start! Hang in there and give it some time.  Like some guys you may get bigger and then again you may have reached your full potential  Either way the average for an adult male is 6 to 7 inches.  Sure there are guys with a bigger penis, but there are also a lot of guys with a smaller penis who would trade for yours in a minute.  And as anyone can tell you, it is definitely not the size that counts, it's in knowing  what you are doing with what you already have.  Don't ever feel like you got cheated! Take the time while you are young to explore your body and to learn your likes and dislikes so that you can communicate them to your future sex partner.  Good luck!1	If light travels at 299,792,458 meters/sec, then how fast does dark travels?

Is the Jeep brand good ? Well, you are not going to get that much for 500 bucks. JEEP IS NOT A GOOD BRAND. It is better to get a reputable brand like Jami or Kona but first you have to decide on what you are going to use this bike for. The main categories are trail bikes,cross country race bikes, black diamond bikes,downhill bikes,mountain cross bikes and jump bikes.                                                                                                                    If you are just going around the trail now and then there is no point in buying anything other that a trail bike. The rest are expensive and unpractical. I would recommend a Specialized ,GT,Kona,Trek or Jamis is fine. Look for something with disk brakes,aluminum frame,decent front fork with more than 3 inches of travel and a rear shock but you are going to spend more money for the nicer features. Buy from a reputable dealer and don't make any hasty decisions. If you need more information buy any mountain bike magazine buyers guide or go to a dealer.2	how do you get rid of celluite in your but and thighs? i am not over weight but my old man says i look good and he is like a toothpick. i dave dimples in my but and thighs. how can i get rid of this?

Depends if you are asking about carpets or actual steam cleaning as used in industry.  Since you didn't say which I will answer both.\n\n1. Carpets.  Does not use steam but very hot water mixed with a solvent or detergent.  It uses pressure to make sure the solution penetrates deep and then vacuums the solution and removed dirt and hopefully grease into a holding tank for disposal.  A much cheaper and slightly more effective mixture than commercial cleaning fluids is real lemon juice.  The various acids naturally in lemon are a very effective grease cutter and also act as a fabric brightner.  Use the same amount as you would commericial cleaner.  (It can be used pure in a squirt bottle to degrease a dirty engine.  Spray on wait (the time it takes to spray should be long enough) and rinse or spray off.  I suggest spraying off with the same bottle.  That you won't get the wires wet and need to wait before starting the car.\n\n2. Industry.  Actually does steam and requires the user to wear a heat and waterproof suit.  The high temperature and presurre very effectively removes dirt and grease.  Usually it is used on machines heavily caked with grease.\n\nHope this helps5	World Cup Pool? HELP!!

Me and my boyfriend of 5 years broke up because we were too different and it was never gonna work out.. but we still couldn't completely cut eachother out of our lives.. But then I couldn't really move on either, so I told him that he should stop calling. He didn't want to, so I had to lie and tell him I don't love him anymore. He stopped calling.. Now I literally feel that my heart is broken.. because I really love him with all my heart but have to let him go for both of our sakes.. I feel so empty.. benita... 5 years, did you say?? that is a long time.. and being without someone to care for you after 5 years is really lonely. thats the reason you are feeling empty. But hey, when both of you have agreed that it aint gonna work out, the best thing to do would be to forget the last five years and look for someone new. After all, there are many more fish in the ocean!\n\nI know it is tough benita, but you are making it harder for yourself if you continue in this fashion. you know deep inside that you have to forget him eventually, but you are counting on your heart and mind to do that for you over time. But hey, that may take very long. You have got to help yourself. And the best way to do that is to find yourself a new friend or guy that can care for you and that you can care for...\n\nthink it over.2	Is a woman's Period really blood?

The Ohio State University/University of Michigan rivalry in football began with their first game in 1897.  UM won that game 34 to 0 and dominated the series until 1919.  That year the tables were turned and the Buckeyes won 13 to 3.  \n\nThe Ohio State/Michigan game has always been important, but it was not always the last game of the season.  This practice began in 1935 and, except for one year, the tradition has continued.  Often the game has determined who is the winner of the Big Ten and who will represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.  An ESPN poll rated the rivalry as the greatest of all time.  \n\n“Ohio State/Michigan Week” has grown beyond the football game to include the annual blood battle, which benefits the Red Cross, food collection for food banks, and spirit events such as banner contests.  OSU and UM have turned the rivalry into an event that helps people across school lines.\nGreat website ive been there alot Michiagan has dominated that rivalry.

I need to know what exactally the Photoshop is and where i can get it the cheapest. When I went to Amazon to look it up it said that it costs around $600. Is is like a program that or something entirley diffrent? Photoshop is one of the top photo editing software programs you can get.  Very few people really need the main photoshop software unless they are editing pictures for a living.  It is made by Adobe which has a lower end product that you can buy for a lot less that will do a lot of the same type of stuff.  If you absolutely need this software you then hopefully you are a student or work at a university.  If so then you can get a discount from them that will make it less than half that price.  Beyond that you should try ebay as people often sell it there for less.9	Should reproductive rights be a partisan issue? What other concerns should the government consider? Let's find issues which are interesting for both men and women, not just females. Well, Cooljerk, when you named yourself at least you got it half right.  I feel abortion shouldn't be a partisan issue and I feel very strongly that men need to stay out of it.   The government needs to concern themselves with Healthcare, not just for elder's, or single parent's, but for everyone.  Especially those with Mental Health issues that can't get their medications because of costs or getting to the Dr in the first place.  Environment, is another big one, unfortunately not big enough with the Democrats, and non existent with the Republicans.   Education is a HUGE one.  We may be superior to other countries but it's not gonna do us any good if we're a bunch of idiots.  I feel our standards in school are too low.  I don't feel that all parents push their kids to realize their potential   There are too many high school dropouts and I feel strongly that their needs to be legislation against it.  And I think EVERYONE should have the opportunity to go to college or a university and not be held back because of costs.  I realize these are already partisan issues but they need to focus on them more and less on  Roe v Wade.5	Why did Kobe all of a sudden decide to become a passer instead of a scorer in the playoffs? I'm not complaining by any means because the Lakers are exceeding expectations in the playoffs. I'm just wondering how and why he came to such a decision to be just another Laker than to be Kobe Bryant. From the moment the Lakers-Suns series got started he was passing more than shooting. Why? You can play around more in the regular season than in the playoffs. In the Playoffs, you have to play a more complete brand of basketball to win. Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring.0	One for all you religious zealots out there? If I believed that the universe was created by a large pink rabbit called Bernard and I consumed Coke and Snickers for my Holy Communion and hung upside down and screamed to pray, no-one would take me seriously.

Their intangibility causes too much agony among the masses. \n\nOh, Bernard! I pray to thee!3	What Military actions took place at Washington and Baltimore in 1814?

Indiana Law states that emancipation occurs when you become a member of the armed services.  Indiana National Guard is a branch of the Army National Guard,  it is not a state militia.  So I am wondering if this means he will be automatically emancipated and my child support obligations will cease. He's an adult at 18 regardless of military status.  Your child support obligations ended the day he turned 18.  If you have a contractual obligation to pay for college or otherwise support him past the age of 18, his enlisting in the military will not nulify the obligations, but you should no longer be paying standard child support to his other parent.5	If best batsman & bowlers of Pakistan & India played in 1 team?Can they beat Australia?  no .. because to beat australia u need a team work and when two individual teams player play as the one team they lack this ability .. the best examply of world 11 and asia 11.. so u need to be a unit to beat the Hell of Aussies1	why does honey solidify? \nthere anything you can do make \nhoney go back to it's clear fluid \nstate?  stand the jar of honey in boiling waterit should go runny.9	Someone posted a question that I'm pretty sure I thought of first...can I take legal action?

Times when our emergence was only in the beginning stages. A time when the morning star fell from the sky to rule with darkness. A time when the biggest conspiracy ever was born. A conspiracy to eliminate all souls from an isolated planet. Millions are apart of this plan and are oblivious to its existence.  Do you think that when Jesus was tempted on the mount, he was tempted as you and I are tempted today? \n\n    We live in a world where we are told how to think, act, and live. "Their" way is pounded into our very being from preschool. We are a product of lies and deception and most of us live oblivious to this reality. Our reality is even a lie and a cover for the truth. We have no control over any aspect of our lives accept for our thoughts and our souls. We are those that are controlled by the controllers. We are a byproduct of the plan of the elders. What is the plan of the elders? Who are the elders?\n\n    Well, the plans of the elders are the blue prints of the greatest conspiracy of all. A conspiracy so concise most all humanity has never realized its existence. Most will read this and still not understand the importance of its message and will still not realize that this world has been shaped and molded throughout all of history by the plan of the elders. There are signs all around us and have been throughout history. The elders are here and have been since before man. They rule in darkness and death is their signature. Power and influence are their ways. To control those who control the masses are their jobs. It’s a blueprint of the greatest magnitude and so far it has been followed to a tee. \n\n    The elders are the spirits of the under world. Their leader is the great morning star. They mapped the blue print of all humanity. They have everything to do with the powers of this world. They appoint our leaders and use their most powerful appointees to implement their plan. Things will be done their way and nothing will stop them. They are in control of the famines and diseases of this world. Our leaders and scientists do their bidding. Our leaders play God and in their minds they are who they play. The masses mean nothing. If the good in man overpowered the evil would we not work to eliminate viruses instead of creating the death that will soon come to haunt us? You talk about conspiracies, have you ever stopped to think that all of history is a great conspiracy on a supernatural level? The greatest conspiracy is a blueprint to control this world and all that’s in it, one government at a time. The conclusion of this conspiracy is to eliminate all peoples that have been created by God. \n\n    So those that control us are also controlled. Over powered mentally like robots. They play their roles and we allow them unknowingly that we help in this plan by doing so. Life is so complex! We talk about smaller conspiracies that have to do with governments especially the United States. However these conspiracies are a byproduct of the Great Plan of the Elders which dates back to before Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve played their roles as we play ours. Our children will play their roles as well, and the plan will go unstopped until the season is right. The trees are BUDDING!!!!!!! First, I like the way you posed your question; quite eloquent.\n\nNow, sure I agree somewhat with your perception of things. However, the world, the Earth that is, is a pretty big place. But, alas, that's not what you're getting at. What YOU'RE really talking about is revealed in this passage:\n\n"A conspiracy to eliminate all souls from an isolated planet. Millions are apart of this plan and are oblivious to its existence. Do you think that when Jesus was tempted on the mount, he was tempted as you and I are tempted today? "\n\nBasically, you're talking about the battle between GOOD and EVIL, I'm like totally sure and stuff, except maybe just remove the "GOOD" from the equation, and POOF! we get your message. ONE completely rational hypothesis; yet can never be proven, AND there are also an infinite number of other equally possible hypothesese.\n\nSo, the essence of these "Elders" are controlling the choices of the people in power, ehh? The people in power ONLY? You say, "The elders are the spirits of the under world. Their leader is the great morning star...They appoint our leaders and use their most powerful appointees to implement their plan. Things will be done their way and nothing will stop them..." You see.. I'm not really down with that logic. Why wouldn't the elders just screw with everyone's minds? It sounds like these "elders" are somewhat god-like. So, they're more like a spirit or something? This isn't jiving.\n\nWho the heck is this "Morning Star" character though? That doesn't make sense? What? It's the thing that controls the "elders?" It sounds like a kind-of, whatdyacallit, FRACTAL, but a fractal of CONTROL. Analogous to the "size" of the universe compared to the "size" of subatomic particals, so is it so with that which controls the will of man. Ans so pessimistic! I'm not buying it. You gotta get the fact that there's always two opposing forces. Whatever it be. Light and Dark. Up and Down. Male and Female. GOOD and EVIL. Sounds like you're really seeing the EVIL side of things through a GOOD person's eyes (possibly?).\n\nFinal answer? Instigate. Perpetuate. Propogate. Investigate. PERORATE!\n\nIn any case, I like that thing about the "Great Plan of the Elders which dates back to before Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve played their roles as we play ours..." That's pretty interesting. It could either mean, before the earth even existed? Or else it could mean, the communities and civilizations that existed before this "Adam and Eve" EXPERIMENT took place.2	Prostate cancer........Help !!!!!?

I am a Rupublican, but I am curious to see what is going to be done in Congress. The Democrats campaigned on changes being made, but did set themselves up for failure? I am optimistic about the changes being made in Iraq, but I feel like if the Democrats don't follow through with all their "changes," the voters in 2008 will notice. If good things happen, 2008 will be deja vu for Republicans. But let it be known, if Democrats fail to serve the American people as they promised, it could be a landslide victory for the Republicans. The Democrats owe so many people and groups, that they have to betray some of them.\nEven Al Qaeda says the Democrats owes them for helping with the Democrat Victory.\nMost of the New Democrats ran as Republicans:  pro-life, pro-gun, and smaller government.\nWHO GETS BETRAYED?\nAnd will Democrat Voters be smart enough to know that they've even been betrayed?\nIt's going to be fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!9	Need an explanation of the VII amendment.

Firstly, I'm guessing it was "stuck" in the esophagus.  If it were in the windpipe, the person wouldn't be able to break, speak, etc.  Second, most of the time when it feels as if a pill is stuck in the esophagus, it is really just a leftover feeling from going down without a lot of fluid to buffer it. And lastly :),  a liquid taken afterward would help get rid of the feeling and no matter what (unless it really is in the windpipe), it will be effective.5	How do you find the age of a Western Flyer bicycle using its serial number?  If it has a Sturmey Archer rear hub on the wheel, especially a 3-speed, the date will be printed on the hub.  \n\nSee www.sheldonbrown.com for more information about this type of bike. \nAlso, there are several Western Flyer collectors on the web.  \n\nSome of the Western Flyer are commuter grade and some are less.  Rarely, there are a few very stylish cruisers in the Western Flyer brand, so those are worth more.  The higher value models are almost all 3 speed, with a few derailleur based.  The lower value models are almost all single speed.  \nThe rare exception is one or two outrageously styled single speed cruisers that were made in the 50's.  Those are also valuable, but without the date on the hub, you'll have to look at classic collector's websites.\nNot matter what date, the more outrageous the styling, the higher the value of the Western Flyer bikes.    \n\nBut, I'm saying, check and see if it is a 3 speed, and if so, just read the date right off the rear hub.  ;)2	Adderall/alcohol liver damage?

You are, always a different one.\n\nEvery time a decision is made somewhere, the universe divides into the number of possible outcomes. Since the universe is infinite, then an infinite number of decisions are made, and therefore there are infinite numbers of alternate universes forming every second. Our consciousness as we experience it follows its own course determined by the decisions we make. Thus, we are always and will always be unaware of passage through these universes.\n\nAlso, think of it this way:  in an alternate universe Hitler won World War II. Do you think you exist there? How different do you think you are? Our present "universe" and that one have diverged, probably far.2	I'm twelve how can i grow faster? I'm only like 4'11" and I want to know what will make me grow.    Please give me some advice. As someone said, you still have as many as 9-10 years left to reach your full height! My wife says she actually grew an inch between age 20 and 22. \n\nMuch of it is genetic (how tall are your parents?). Our kid is 6'4" at age 16, but I'm 6'3" and my wife 5'7". Both of us had one tall parent (dads) and short moms, so obviously, one side may "win out".\n\nFirst, make sure you are eating enough calories. (see the Healthy Body Calculator at the site below) Eat plenty of protein, for your muscles and calcium-rich foods, for your bone growth, and carbohydrates for energy. If you don't like dairy, leafy green veggies have calcium, or you can take a supplement. Make sure it's Calcium CITRATE, since it's absorbed better, and combined with magnesium.  You can also get foods enriched w/calcium, like cereals and juices.\n\nExercise is important (strong muscles stimulate bone growth and strength), as is the proper amount of sleep. Teens need at least NINE hours a night, and they often don't get it, so make sure you don't stay up too late. \n\nAvoid the pressure to be too thin, as this will stunt your growth. Also, avoid cigarettes, alcohol and any drugs (obviously).\n\nSome prescription drugs can interfere with growth, such as anti-anxiety drugs, anti-depressants and others. Check with your doctor (if you're on any of these) to see which ones you can switch. \n\nYour problem may just be that your are maturing more slowly than your peers, which is usually normal. If lack of growth continues, however, check w/your doctor to test for things like thyroid problems (and other endocrine (gland) disorders) and diabetes.\n\nIf you follow healthy eating, sleep and exercise, you should catch up to your peers soon. Also, you may never become as tall as most others, but don't let that interfere with your self esteem. Many attractive women are actually shorter (J-Lo, for instance) Don't worry!8	Its about a girl?

I understand the biology behind burning and pain and I understand the purpose served by pain (to warn the body that something bad is happening to it and to pull away, reducing damage), but can anyone succintly explain the chemical/physical reaction that occurs to cause the actual burning of the tongue, finger etc? OK.\n\nTo start from basics\n\nThe human body is made up mostly of cells. Cells are mostly microscopic bubbles of oil with salt water inside them. That accounts for 99% for what a cell is. The rest of the cell is the ‘important’ stuff that keeps the cell active and allows it to communicate and so forth.  And most of that stuff is protein.\n\nA protein is a molecule comprising a chain of smaller molecules called amino acids. There are millions of different types of proteins, and they are the basic machinery of living organisms. Proteins digest food, and they burn food to produce energy, they break down waste and move materials into and out of cells and they carry oxygen around the bloodstream. The chemical engines that make up muscles are proteins, so proteins are also entirely responsible for movement. Basically if something changes inside the human body, proteins are responsible.\n\nProteins also make up most of the structure in the human body. Cells really are just bags of oil containing salt water, they have no structural integrity of their own. They rely on protein fibres both within the cell and between cells to allows them to maintain their shape. Your body maintains it shape because of proteins.\n\nSo what happens when you get burned?  Well the first thing that happens is that the proteins break down. The arrangement of the amino acids molecules gets shaken up and the proteins lose their shape, and without their shape they become non functional, useless. And because all the functions of a cell depend on proteins the cells themselves become nonfunctional. Just as importantly the structural proteins break down and lose shape. That results in the cells and tissues losing their shape. \n\nThat breakdown of proteins is what is technically termed denaturation. The more common term is ‘cooking’. When we cook animals food we are largely trying to break down the proteins so that they are easier to digest. That is why cooked food is more tender than raw food, because the structural proteins have been smashed to pieces by the heat. A burn is nothing more or less than cooking of living tissue.\n\nThe first proteins to suffer from a burn are usually those on the surface of the cell. Those proteins are either embedded in the cell membrane with one end sticking out, or they are just sitting on the surface waiting for molecules to come by to react with. Either way, they cook.  The cooking of the surface proteins has one immediate effect: it disrupts water balance. Those proteins were responsible for pumping water and salt in and out of the cell to maintain the correct balance. Once they are damaged water and salts leak into and out of the cell at will.\n\nThe most noticeable effect of this is damage is in the formation of blisters. Water, salt and even proteins leak freely into the damaged area because the proteins that are supposed to prevent it have been cooked into inactivity. We see that as a buildup of plasma under the skin: a blister.\n\n\nThe second thing that occurs if the heat is applied for long enough is that the cells rupture. They are after all just little bags of salt water. As soon as they heat up the bags rupture and spill their watery contents. If they are heated to over 100oC the water inside vaporises.  As a result the cells lose their shape and lose any ability to function. They die. Now we have not just damaged leaking cells but dead and decaying cells. That presents a very real chance of infection if the area is large enough.\n\nFinally if the heat is applied for long enough and intense enough the structural proteins break down. The structural proteins are usually pretty tough, but they will cook eventually. When that happens the burned area loses its structural integrity. We can see this as the skin peeling off a serious burn. Without the protein strands holding the skin together it turns into mush. If the heat is very severe the underlying tissue also suffer destruction of structural tissue and becomes a4	how can i search for items from many tables in a database? i am usin mysql and php There are many methods..\nyou can create a union view , which combines all the different tables that you wanna search into and then make the select statement to the union view..\nother solution , you can make multible select statements, each on a separate table, concatinating the results into your web page.3	11-28-06 myfirst time on answers.

I am in a city at 2700m abouve sea level and was wondering if it easier or harder to get drunk at this altitude. I drank a fair amount last night (although I´m not sure how much as the pub wasn´t measuring the spirits, but they were at least doubles each glass), and I didn´t feel too drunk. \n\nI know I should be able to work out the physics of alcohol disolving in your blood a altitude ect but between me and my friends we could jusify both arguements. Which is right? ok...here goes...I'm going to rival all these answers and I would like someone to give me their opinion as this is opinion.\n\nAt high altitude the body knows there is lower o2 levels. So, kidney function increases..causing more frequent urination. This in itself although maybe initially one would become immebriated would rid the body of alcohol faster.\nAlso the body is instructed to increase rbc production to facilitate more oxygen distribution to cells and organs. This would also reason that alcohol although more readily absorbed would be excreted out of the body faster.\nIt is also known that it takes approximately 2 weeks to acclimate to a different climate. So, while it might make sense that intoxication would occur more rapidly initially, one would summise that after acclimation it would be no different8	Is it cheaper to marry an American girl or is it better to get one from russia for pennies on the dollar?  4	CD-rom keeps opening and shuting?

The bone will heal on its own.  Those are probably one of the few displaced fractures that doesn't require surgery.  I don't know how old your mom is, but those in their60's and 70's tend to heal a little slower.  Women also have the unfortunate condition called osteoporosis when they get older, which will also slow down the healing time.  \n\nLike I mentioned, not all fractures or breaks require surgical repair.  Clavicle fractures (collar bone) will be left in their broken position and sent home to follow up with an orthopaedic doctor.  I would recommend an ortho follow up, just to make sure she is healing properly and no neurological deficits occur.3	are you afraid to fall in luv agen???

For someone who isolates themselves from others it is helpful for the person to try to do something where people are involved but you don't have to talk to them like go for  a drive where people are around. Something that involves people but causes the least amount of anxiety. Once the person has no more anxiety from that move up a level. Like getting out of the car and going for a walk with few people around. Each level should involve more people, more anxiety but enough to handle in small doses until the anxiety is gone. The final test would be  going to some kind of social function. It's a gradual process that can help get rid of the anxiety. It will be slightly uncomfortable but it does work and as you or someone you are trying to help goes through this they will see as they reach each level there level of anxiety will decrease. They need to remember the thought of what could happen not what will is where the anxiety comes from. Another good thing to do is write down what you think will happen if you go out and then write down what does happen. What you think will happen most likely won't. The more you isolate yourself the worse the anxiety gets. Your basically  reinforcing your anxiety every time you avoid other people. Good Luck.3	I need history of transfer day in the virgin islands?

Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. The project was stillborn because Napoleon was defeated and was forced to withdraw from the Near East. The letter is remarkable because it marks the coming of age of enlightenment philosophy, making it respectable at last to integrate Jews as equal citizens in Europe and because it marked the beginning of nineteenth century projects for Jewish autonomy in Palestine under a colonial protectorate. After the defeat of Napoleon, it was largely the British who carried forward these projects, which have in hindsight been given the somewhat misleading name of "British Zionism."9	War on Iraq after 3 years ,no weapon of destruction ,why it happens and why hundreds of people dying ? i am computer engineer ,live in baghdad,iraq,every day i go work,i think this is the last time i see my parents,there is unknown enemy out in the streets,ready to kill for nothing just to increase the no. of deads .political people who now rule iraq are interesting in nothing but to gain(steal) money and oil.\nconditions here are difficult to live with,electricity recources,fuel especialy.\nyoung peolpe who want to settle and compose afamily ,always hesitating about that cause noone want to bring up a baby to such a live with unknown future and dark present.

Let's say you are a strict fundamentalist Christian and you are head nurse at your hospital, where a man has just been admitted. The first person who comes to visit him is his partner who is ALSO a man and you realize they are both gay. He wants to be at his partner's side and have the same visitor privilages as any spouse would. \n\nAlthough the hospital has formal rules on visitation, "Family Members Only" they also informally try to accomodate non-traditional families but leave it up to the discretion of the Head Nurse on duty to make the "Call". That person is YOU. However, you disagree STRONGLY with people being gay. \n\nDo you allow this man's partner to visit him even or enforce the formal rule, even if it CAN be bent at your discretion? I would bend the rule. My job as a Christian is to serve people and care for their needs. I need to respect them as people, setting an example in how I treat them rather than by controlling them.\n\nWhy should I pull away support from this person in their time of need? What sort of love is that? It certainly doesn't bring them closer to God, it just torments them in their time of need and brings enmity.\n\nI would guess the fundamentalist would enforce the rule because they believe homosexuality is wrong, so this guy's not really a "family member" and thus the rule is more important than this guy not being alone. \n\nAt the very least, the head nurse could visit the patient, in order to provide support, regardless of sexual orientation.6	what was captain starlights real name ? robery under arms, stole cattle near Winton QLD then drove them to SA He was a ficticious character and opinions vary as to who his true identity was - see links below for a few\n--------\nThe real Captain Starlight was a villain named Frank Pearson, who at various times used aliases including Dr. Pearson, Major Lacey and Gordon. He was born in England in 1837 and arrived in Australia in 1866.

The Braves were one of three expansion franchises to join the NBA that year (the Portland Trail Blazers and the Cleveland Cavaliers were the other two), as the league dueled with the upstart American Basketball Association for prominence. After struggling through their first few campaigns, the Braves soon found playoff success under the coaching of the legendary Dr. Jack Ramsay and high scoring Bob McAdoo. Unfortunately, drastic changes in the organization's ownership during the 1976-77 season threw the team into a tailspin, resulting in back-to-back losing seasons. \n\nFollowing a proposal by then-NBA attorney David Stern, the Braves were allowed to leave Buffalo after the 1977-78 season for San Diego. The deal was a complicated one, as Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown traded places with Boston Celtics owner Irv Levin. Levin, a California businessman, was unhappy in Boston and relished the opportunity to own a team in his home state. Levin immediately renamed the club the Clippers due to San Diego's bustling harbor and seaside locale. \n\nclip·per    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (klpr)\nn. \n1) One that cuts, shears, or clips. \n2) An instrument or tool for cutting, clipping, or shearing.

Florida Supreme Court1	details of electrons anyone? What will happen if electrons do not revolve round the nucleas?Where does the energy in spinning electrons come from? The correct way to think of an electron around an atomic nucleus is to think of an electrostatic "potential well". The electron is trapped inside the well, so there is no need for the electron to revolve or spin around the nucleus. However, the electron does have angular momentum, but this is not the classical angular momentum you are used to (because electrons are point particles and do not have physical extension like a ball rotating about its center of mass). For an electron, its angular momentum are quantized, and also include a "spin" component that has nothing to do with "spinning" around an axis, but does have something to do with orientation. Also, in terms of picturing the electron around the atomic nucleus, it is useful to think of it as a cloud, smeared and surrounding the nucleus. But what kind of cloud is it? This obviously is not a cloud of gas, rather the cloud metaphor is to denote the fact that we do NOT know where the electron is at any given moment. This has to do with Hisenberg's Uncertainty Priniple. If we knew exactly where it is, then we would have no idea what momentum it has, which implies that the electron would gain energy and escape the nucleus.\n\nSo to answer your question, "what will happen if electrons do not revolve around the nucleus?" The electron may escape the nucleus if it receives the right amount of energy. For example, a photon or light of a certain frequency can collide with the electron and impart its energy to the electron and thus causes the electron to escape the nucleus. This is called the Photo-Electric Effect (as discovered by Einsteinand winning him a Nobel Prize).\n\n"Where does the energy in spinning electrons come from?" The electrons trapped inside the potential well of an atomic nucleus must be in certain quantum states that correspond to a certain amount of energy. This corresponds to the binding energy of the electron to the nucleus, which is also the energy required in order for the electron to escape the nucleus.\n\nAs a side note, the most "accepted" view of an electron among  quantum physicists is that the electron is a "wave packet". The wave packet is a mathematical representation of the probability of finding the electron at some position (x,y,z) and at time, t.9	why dont california unions like governor arnold schwarzneggar?  because the mafia supports democrats6	Why are birds afraid of owls?

From the reference attached, 1 m^3 will lift 1 kg. \n\nso 100/2.2 m^3 are necessary to lift 1kg, more or less\n\nHowever, it is better to figure it out carefully.\n\nD=density of air at sea level, temperature T\nDHe=density of helium at sea level, temperature T\n\nBuoyant force of helium of volume V is equal to weight of air displaced (Archimedes), so \nB=D*V*g\nwhere g is acceleration of gravity. \nWeight of helium of volume V is DHe*V*g\n\nWeight to be lifted is W\n\nSo to balance these, \n\nB=DHe*V*g+W\nor \nD*V*g=DHe*V*g+W\n\nand V*(D-DHe)*g=W\nso V=W/[g*(D-DHe)]\n\nJust substitute for W, g, D, DHe and you have your answer.7	Ive never been a fan of Gibert Gottfried... but than I saw the movie Aristocrats.. now I want his new CD......

And hopefully you can learn from my passed sin  . IT'S NOT WORTH  IT !!!!   When we get tempted,we are blinded to all the consequences that follow. And believe me, there will be consequences .. but here is the good news.. Being tempted is not a sin .. resist the devil and he will flee from you . trust me, you will be greatly disappointed in the end,with unbelievable heartache . \nIt is the Christians duty to cast  down those imaginations that exault themselves above God and bring them into the obedience and captivity of Jesus .. Shut the thoughts down, and replace them with God's word .. Lord Bless you ....\n\nemotional closeness can very well lead to physical . The devil knows how to set that up like nobodies business .   he will do what ever he can to acomplish his goal .3	could anyone help me find resources for my son? he has mild autism & learning difficulties and i'd be very greatful if anybody can suggest a good website with software or resources for him. tried do2learn.....could you help me? we use a fantastic site for special needs http://www.priorywoods.middlesbrough.sch.uk/  plenty of free resources and online games5	what will be the score of Steaua - Rapid game tonight?  2-14	how can i speed up my dsn timing with a .org tld?

Not specific to LA but I was a path assistant in IL and it was if you die in custody, within 72 or 96 hours after a surgical procedure, if investigating officials deem it undetermined, a special ward of the state, children under the age of 12 or 16(i forget) if not determined natural/accidental or if the family asks for one.

As someone has already said, empires rise and fall. One of the first signs of weakness is when a country thinks it is so powerful that it can do what it wants. I think the US has stood for lots of good things in the past and has helped a lot of countries but Guantanamo, for example, lessens its moral authority. The war in Iraq seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. They had to nail some bad guy (with the right ethnic and/or religious background) whether he had anything to do with 9/11 or not. You expect things like this from a totalitarian government, not from the US. They would have been a lot better off concentrating on Afghanistan where they could have made a real difference.  \n\nHowever, if the US works more closely with other countries which, by the way, have had democracy for as long or longer, they will do a lot better than following the adage "my way or highway". As a great admirer of Roosevelt and Lincoln I can only shake my head in dismay when I think of the commander in chief you have now. The sooner he goes, the quicker the US will make ammends. By the way, I am no admirer of the Democrats. I just like people in charge who know what they are doing.8	Whats the best way of masturrbation you have done?  alone in my room fingering myself and fantasizing someone i really want to have sex w/.awesome!8	what should I tell her?

He stopped when he was in third grade, as, there was no local tennis court. he's started playing on a regular basis and started taking lessons and everything since he was 10. He's on the middle school travel team. Is his dream on going pro realistic? I've heard that most pros today started playing on a regular basis since they were 2. When I was a kid playing tennis at our local park with my friends, I remember dreaming of the pro tour. We were all pretty decent players, but I remember going to my first big junior tournament. I ended up losing both the matches I played to kids in my age group. I then realized how much work was ahead of me. I spent the next few years going to junior clinics and private lessons. It was a great experience and I really improved. I never realized the dream of being on the pro tour that I had as a 12 year-old kid, but that's because I had to decide between devoting my life to tennis (spending hours per day on court and in lessons) or pursuing my education.\n\nThat being said, some kids are born with the special combination of hand-eye coordination and athletic ability that enables them to be a professional tennis player even if they pick up their first racquet at 16 years old. So, if your son started at 5, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Heck, even if he isn't dominating high school varsity players while still in middle school he can still make it to the pro tour. The secret is by being good enough to play D1 tennis. If he plays at the NCAA D1 level, he'll then have the chance to succeed, play in challenger tournaments, and gain an ATP ranking.\n\nHowever, if his dream is of being the next Federer, then he really should be dominating every tournament he enters on both the city-wide level, but also the USTA regional tournaments. He should be one of the top players in the state. If this isn't the case, he can still make it, but it's going to take lots of effort. Jim Courier is a good example of a former pro who wasn't blessed with a lot of physical ability, but through 'blood, sweat, and tears' was able to turn the ability that he did have into a style of play that led him to success on the pro tour.\n\nIf you want more information on tournaments--because they're really the key to becoming a pro player--then I recommend the USTA website. I'll include several links in the sources for you (a link to the USTA junior tournament page, to the USTA future champions page, and to the USTA sections page--where you'll be able to go to your region's website and find more information on regional and local tournaments).\n\nAnyway, I hope that everything works out, and that I was able to help.3	what makes my anal hole burn when i eate peppers.?  as*holiosis.5	how many attendees was at the chicago cubs game for the hole year in 2005?

If they're lucky with the Group E results (that could have them facing Ghana rather than Italy or Czech Rep) they could go as far as the semis.\n\nBut that's where the fairytale will surely end, as Germany is a likely opponent, and Germany will probably win unless they play as poorly as they did at last year's Confed Cup (we only lost that one because Frank Farina was coaching the side at the time).\n\nI think they're good to make the round of 16, and if they face Italy they may push them all the way to penalty shootout, which Australia is no stranger to, but if Italy scores it may be all over.\n\nBut no matter how the game against Croatia goes, Aussies can all be proud of their football team who have certainly raised the bar for future Socceroos sides.4	Help, my cellphone won't be recognized!? I recently got a new Motorola RAZR V3 and with it came a Software to connect it to my PC. I installed the software (called Motorola Phone Tools) but it won't recognize the cellphone. I have tried installing updates and reconnecting the cellphone several times but it just won't work. What can I do? Ok, first off, uninstall mobile phone tools and lets start from scratch.  install the mobile phone tools cd.  DO NOT PLUG IN THE USB CABLE OR CONNECT YOUR PHONE! Once the cd is installed, then run "live update".  For step by step instructions on how to do that including screen shots, please click here: http://motorola.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/motorola.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=5526\n\nOnce that is complete, connect your usb cable and phone when prompted.  \n\nYou should see your phone on the screen, and it should also recognize your phone.  There are further technical troubleshooting tips here:\nhttp://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/Motosupport/source/AdvancedMobility_PhoneTools.asp\n\nYou can also call Motorola toll free at 1-866-289-6686 for support should all else fail (please try to call them from a land line or other phone than the RAZR, you will need to be able to connect that to the PC during the call).  If all the software is installed properly and it is connected properly, try putting it into another USB port.\n\nIf all that fails, maybe its a bad cable.  Contact the place you purchased it from and let them know.  Give them a chance to replace the cable.1	what strategy should i use for objective type question paper for medical entrance? total questions 200\n50-phy\nchem-50\nbio-100\ntime- 3hrs\ndifficulty level- moderate to high\nall the options are very similar that even sometimes teachers are not able to solve.

I have a 256 pc2700 and a 512 pc2100 no i do know it will make the pc operate at 2100 speed , but is it really that noticable. how much speed am i losing? depends. pc2700 is better because it is faster memory than pc2100. But, remember, if you have a pc/laptop that accepts pc2100, then you can put a pc2700 memory in it but it will not make your laptop faster. It works only because all memory modules are backward compatible and work with old slots but will not be able to take advantage of the speed capabilities of the newer memory modules.4	can i find out the person who owns a url?

Winning Pitcher in a ball game.\nStarting Pitcher has to leave the ball game with the lead lets say 5-4 at the half way point in which if the game was called due to weather or any other odd thing, 9 innings they call it the 5th Inning so both teams get the same amount of field time. Now he can leave with the lead and the team win and not get it if the other team scores more then what his team had when he left. So if its 6-5 final he would get the no decision and the pitcher who was pitching at the time they scored the winning run would get the win. Easy and clear as mud huh. \n\nMain thing to remember is after 5 who ever is pitching for the team that won when the winning run happend. Not the next inning but that inning.3	what is Performance evaluation?  Somebody at work wants to see if you are profitable to the company.

That's depending on what type of metal you want to cover the steel parts in the galvanization process. \n\nThe galvanization in words refers only to that kind of process which is using electric deposition of a metal through a bath of a electrolyte from a plate containing pure metal needing to be deposed on steel tide at the "anode" electrode or "+" polarity and at the other side (other electrode, "cathode" or "-" polarity).\n\nThere needs to be a certain recipe of mixed salts for creating very tight and uniform growth crystals, for not being corroded or leafed away with time. There are certain salts which provide this king of growing in the same time with the polished look of the piece galvanized. This salts can be dissolved in water,  for creating the electrolyte or being melt (which is not so safe technique) and used and kept like that. \n\nThe "dipping" is no so used any more and it can not be called "galvanization". More recent techniques use hot plasma blowers, meaning a torch with plasma and a wire of the specific metal to be deposited being melt in the plasma and blown to the surface of the steel part.\n\nAnything you'll do you have to deal with the local Environmental Agencies and with the tap water supply/ sewerage administrator, because you;ll have to make a contract with them for you to show that you retain the hard metals from the water dropped to sewerage, if any.\nDfriend:)3	Here is a hard riddle?

It is widely known that apples and oranges share a common hatred of each other. This dates back to the 13th century and the "citrus inquistion", one of the most hienous examples of fuiticide in history. Oranges mounted an organize campaign to "drive apples into the sea". Later the tables were turned, when in the early 19th century oranges exacted a delicious revenge by squeezing the oranges out of their homes in a vicious rampage known as the "Granny Smith Massacre".6	list the stocks recommended in NSE for tomorrow?

Where can I find information on how prisoners are treated, such as websites and such. I am doing a problem/solution essay and I have heard that prisoners are treated way better than they ever should be, and would like to write my paper on that. Thanks in advance. who ever told you that non sense is a sorry piece of work. Prison is more horrible than you can imagine. Imagine being told when to urinate,eat,sleep, and being locked down 24 hrs a day in a 2 man cell which is smaller than two foot lockers ...Imagine eating bugs. Imagine getting your manhood or womanhood taken by a prison guard. Imagine loosing all of your belongings when you get out you have lost everything, family, house, pets. You now live on the streets after being treated like dirt. Now put this in your term paper. I am one of those prisoners that was wrongfully accused. Of course our justice system didn't work because of all the political bullshit. I did a year and let me tell you it is the worst nightmare you can imagine. Imagine screaming all night every night. Never sleeping. Terrible food. Fights all day. People crying, people getting rolled up out of bed because they are having seizures. In which they roll the people out in hallways on their stomachs until the seizure stops and they are drooling. They then roll them back into their to oms on their stomachs and leave them. Before you write a term paper go the jails institutions and death no lies.com\nGET REAL. KNOW THE FACTS....ONE MORE THING RATS EAT YOUR FOOD AND CLOTHS TOO.\n\nIn a report for the United Nations' Committee against Torture, the London-based human rights group also alleged abuses within the U.S. domestic law enforcement system, including use of excessive force by police and degrading conditions of isolation for inmates in high security prisons.\n\n"Evidence continues to emerge of widespread torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of detainees held in U.S. custody," Amnesty said in its 47-page report. \n\nIt said that while Washington has sought to blame abuses that have recently come to light on "aberrant soldiers and lack of oversight", much ill-treatment stemmed from officially sanctioned interrogation procedures and techniques.\n\n"The U.S. government is not only failing to take steps to eradicate torture, it is actually creating a climate in which torture and other ill-treatment can flourish," said Amnesty International USA Senior Deputy Director-General Curt Goering.\n\nThe U.N. committee, whose experts carry out periodic reviews of countries signatory to the U.N. Convention against Torture, is scheduled to begin consideration of the United States on Friday. The last U.S. review was in 2000.\n\nIt said in November it was seeking U.S. answers to questions including whether Washington operated secret detention centers abroad and whether President George W. Bush had the power to absolve anyone from criminal responsibility in torture cases.\n\nThe committee also wanted to know whether a December 2004 memorandum from the U.S. Attorney General's office, reserving torture for "extreme" acts of cruelty, was compatible with the global convention barring all forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.\n\n\nUNTIL THE END \nIn its own submission to the committee, published late last year, Washington justified the holding of thousands of foreign terrorism suspects in detention centers abroad, including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, on the grounds that it was fighting a war that was still not over.\n\n"Like other wars, when they start, we do not know when they will end. Still, we may detain combatants until the end of the war," it said.\n\nThe U.S. human rights image has taken a battering abroad over a string of scandals involving the sexual and physical abuse of detainees held by American forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. \n\n\nIn its submission, Washington did not mention alleged secret detention centers.\n\nAmnesty listed a series of incidents in recent years involving torture of detainees in U.S. custody, noting the heaviest sentence given to perpetrators was five months in jail.\n\nThis was the same punishment you could get for stealing a bicycle in the United St0	Is God a torturer and a murderer? There is no doubt that God is the one responsible for evil.  It is written in the Bible itself.\n\nLamentations 3.38-"Is it not from the mouth of the most high that good an evil come?"\n\nIsaiah 45.6-7 - "I am the Lord and there is no other...I make weal and create woe, I am the Lord, who do all these things." (God)\n\nHere is a quick list of the atrocities God is charged with in a court of logic: demanding and sanctioning human sacrifices (Leviticus 27.28-29; Judges11.29-40), Killing innocent firstborn children (Exodus12.29), Sanctioning slavery (Exodus 21.2-6; Leviticus 25.44-46), sanctioning the selling of one's daughter (Exodus 21.7), death for heresy (Exodus 22.20), death for violating the sabbath (Exodus 31.14-15), death for cursing one's parents (Leviticus 20.9), death for adultery (20.10), death for blasphemy (Leviticus 20.16), and death by stoning for women only who had premarital sex (Deuteronomy22.20-21).\n\nIs God really loving and just?  It doesn't seem so to me. The answer to your question is yes.\n\nHe has tortured, tormented and killed people throughout the OT.  He once killed some people when he was gambling with Satan.  He has joined in wars, killed animals and plants, and he allows innocent people to go to Hell and be tortured by his buddy Satan.\n\nAs loving as He is supposed to be, he has committed more atrocities than Hitler.  But then most people don't trouble themselves to actually read the Bible, they just say they are Christian.8	Love Advice?

You have 52 choices for the first card and 51 for the second card, so it's 52*51 choices = 2652 choices\n\nHowever, the above answer counts the Ace of Spades, followed by the King of Spades as one choice, and the King of Spades followed by the Ace of Spades as a different choice.\n\nOrdinarily, we would call those two choices the same thing.  To correct for that, divide the above answer by 2 = 1326 choices.  But either answer is possible, depending on whether you wish to count a different order of the same cards as different or the same.\n\n(For the record, the first answer is 52 P 2, and the second answer is 52 C 2)6	How real and good are the Internet surveys to earn money?  mysurvey.com\n\nYou have to do a lot of surveys for little money, but it's the only site I have found (and I researched it quite a bit) where you don't have to pay to join and the money you get is not just a sweepstakes where your name is entered when you take a survey.\nAt mysurvey.com, signup is free and they email you when surveys you qualify for come up.  For each survey, you earn points (the points differ from survey to survey).  When you get 1000 points, you can request a check for $10.  2000 points gets you $20, etc.  It's slow-going, but the only really profitable survey site out there.2	Could I be lactose intolerant? Everytime I eat Ice cream I feel either bloated or throw up. Its the same with milk but whenever I eat something with chesse I feel fine. You probably have lactose intolerance. That is, your small intestine doesn't produce enough lactase, the enzyme you need to digest lactose, the natural sugar found in dairy products. Never fear, it's not dangerous.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is decrease the amount of milk and dairy products you eat until your symptoms go away.\n\nIf milk is your main source of calcium and you cut back on milk, then you should supplement your diet with substitutes like;  sardines with bones, or spinach or broccoli. Calcium supplements are another option, as are lactase enzymes, pills, or lactase-treated milk.\n\nNever drink milk alone. Some people find their symptoms disappear if they take their dairy products with meals. As you mentioned " eat something with cheese".\n\nEat yoghurt. The organisms that make yoghurt what it is, also produce lactase to digest the lactose contained in yoghurt. Secondly, the bacteria themselves also probably break down the lactose in the milk. \n\nYoghurt is made from pasteurized milk. But sometimes manufacturers repasteurize the yoghurt before they freeze it. This would kill the beneficial organisms that produce lactose.\nSo try to find yoghurt that has not been repasteurized. It means choose regular yoghurt over frozen one.\n\nEat yoghurt before ice cream. If you eat yogurt 5 to 15 minutes before you eat ice cream [or other milk products], probably any symptoms of lactose-intolerance would be less.\n\nTry cheese, too. Cheese has less lactose in it than milk. Hard cheeses are the best,because they're fermented the most. Swiss cheese or extra sharp cheddar cheese contain only a trace amount of lactose and are thus less likely to produce digestive upset.4	how can i change the format on an image?

Is the tree with the leaves that shake in the slightest breeze "trembling birch" or "trembling poplar" Or are both terms OK? The tree you are probably alluding to is the trembling or quaking aspen.

Based on this idea, is it possible for us to define something like  [x]100  (100 in the sub script) when we talk about multiples of 100 or  [x]1  when we talk about the usual greatest integer function.  My question is  - what is the dis-advantage in such a notation'? If one thinks of the graphs of your [[x]]100 and the usual [[x]], one realizes, from normal transformation rules, that your [[x]]100 is actually 100*[[x/100]].\n\nSo the disadvantage would simply be that there's another simple way to denote it.3	Does anybody know what three characteristics all successful civilizations have in common?--?

If you removed enzymes from the body, it would stop working and die! Enzymes are responsible for the functions of every organ. The body is a big efficient chemical factory and enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction.\n\nEvery gene's program is associated with the actions of enzymes. Even vitamins and nutrients can't be used effectively without enzymes.\n\nThe immune system's function is to fight off all foreign invaders in the body such as bacteria, viruses, carcinogens and other chemicals. It relies almost totally on enzymes to do its job. A weakened immune system has a diminished volume of enzymes which includes those that are defective or worn out. Enzymes have a limited life and must be replaced regularly.\n\nWhere do we get enzymes? Nine basic enzymes come from food, and the body takes these and changes them into over 3,000 varieties for various purposes.1	How to graph the function of Y^2=X(Ysquare) on a TI-86 calculator? How can we graph a function with respect to Y on a graphing calculator: ie. X=Y^2+2Y X = Y^2 is not a function. It fails the vertical line test. You cannot graph it on a graphing calculator. (At least not a TI-86.)\n\nYou need to break it into two pieces that don't have multiple y values per x value. In this case, x = y^2 breaks nicely into \ny = square root of x\nand y = - square root of x\n\nAs far as I know, you can't graph X as a function to Y on any TI graphing calculators, but I only know up to the TI-89. You can simulate a graph of a f(y) = x equation but you have to convert it into a piecewise function.9	Illegal Immigrants that are here already - What is the most practical solution?

Also, where is the point of strongest magnetic flux density if say, it is a 3T MRI machine? In the center of the bore? Or is it uniform throughout? Any ferromagnetic material would be attracted to a magnet. Maybe if your ferrite is big enough it may cause the magnet to quench (but I doubt it). The trick with MRI is to have a field gradient so that only a small volume of the "specimen" will be at resonance so the maximum flux points will vary as the scan proceeds.9	Why do liberals have such nasty personality's?

Electric current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in an electric circuit, measured in coulombs/second which is named amperes.\n\nA transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy from one circuit to another by magnetic coupling with no moving parts. A transformer comprises two or more coupled windings, or a single tapped winding and, in most cases, a magnetic core to concentrate magnetic flux.  Transformers are used to convert between high and low voltages, to change impedance, and to provide electrical isolation between circuits.4	How  will I  increase the virtyal memory of my system?

Hope!2	how long after having sex can you show signs of being pergnant? what are some of the earliast signs. Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues. \nAre you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect — or hope — that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.\n\nTender, swollen breasts or nipples\nOne of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.\n\nFatigue\nMany women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.\n\nDuring the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard — pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.\n\nSlight bleeding or cramping\nSome women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.\n\nMany women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.\n\nNausea with or without vomiting\nMorning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.\n\nAlthough nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors — such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke — can trigger nausea.\n\nFood aversions or cravings\nTurning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.\n\nFood cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.\n\nFrequent urination\nMany pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.\n\nHeadaches\nIf you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.\n\nConstipation\nConstipation is ano2	Done by Christmas???

In modern usage, civil engineering is a broad field of engineering that deals with the planning, construction, and maintenance of fixed structures, or public works, as they are related to earth, water, or civilization and their processes. Most civil engineering today deals with roads, Railways, structures, water supply, sewer, flood control and traffic. In essence, civil engineering is a profession which makes the world a more habitable place to live in.\n\nEngineering has developed from observations of the ways natural and constructed systems react and from the development of empirical equations that provide bases for design. Civil engineering is the broadest of the engineering fields. In fact, engineering was once divided into only two fields--military and civil. Civil engineering is still an umbrella field comprised of many related specialties.5	Est ce que Ronaldo va oser echanger son maillot avec Zidane ...? sur le terrain à la fin du match (et donc oser  montrer ses rondeurs ) et non dans les couloirs à l' abri des photos :) Si Zidane ne mets pas plus de 4 buts samedi soir... c'est possible2	Why is my ear swollen? my right ear feels swollen inside and hurts whenever i touch it\ni can hear ok and have never had problems with my ears. there could be few causes but most commonly, its otitis externa meaning infection or inflammation of ear canal which can cause ear canal to swell lot of pain and reduced hearing as a consequence, or 2nd you can get Furunculosis or boil in your ear canal, both these needs treating with antibiotics and strong painkillers.\n1, oral antibiotics like flucloxacillin\n2, ear drops with antibiotics i them\n3, if its very bad, you may need to see ENT specialist who can clean your ears and put ointment or small wick containing medication, which will cure the problems\n\nBUT don't forget to see GP/DOCTOR to get it checked out5	glock 19 for home defense? i was researching a gun for home defense and came upon a page talking about how glock pistols are so easy to use (automatic safeties).  thats not all good if you think about it. what if the gun got into the wrong hands? it would be easy for your own gun to be pointed and shot at you with ease. (robber grabs it befor you) i've heard that some thieves who got hold of someones gun couldnt get a shot off because they didnt know how to work it (safeties, loading..) so it makes glock seem like a bad idea for home defense. can you suggest a better home defense gun to me? what caliber? I am a retired police officer with over 20 years experience in the New Orleans area.  In that time, I have never had a case where the presence of a weapon made any real difference in what took place at your "average" burglary.  Meaning a random burglary where an armed homeowner was present in no way influenced the crimes outcome.  Yes, I have had homeowners shooting at potential burglars but for the most part, burglars when confronted don't stick around.  Of course, there are exceptions.  \n\nMy point is that for the average homeowner having weapons in the house is merely a "feel" good measure and does not offer any kind of deterrent to a burglar.  Residences that are known to have weapons can ultimately become "targets" because the criminal is looking for those weapons.  And believe me, burglars have ways of finding out if you have a cache of weapons.\n\n\nTo answer your question, while it is true that Glocks are "good to go" and could be used against you by an attacker, the opposite is also true for other "more complicated" handguns.  In stressful situation such as a home invasion, if you are not well trained on the weapon's use, you could very well forget to release the safety yourself and thus become a victim anyway.   \n\nIt is well documented that in some police shootings, the police officers were killed with their weapons in hand with the safeties still engaged.  In fact some departments switched to Glocks for that very reason.  If you are concerned about the Glock, you could always leave the first round out of the chamber which would then require you to pull the slide back before firing thus acting as a safety and giving you more time to react if the intruder takes you weapon away.\n\nI think that there are always variables beyond your control and to worry whether or not to keep a Glock or a Berretta (which can be complicated to operate) is a moot point.  \n\nSomeone else suggested a shotgun.  It is the same scenerio.  You would have to release the safety before you could "protect" yourself and I have seen countless times in shotgun training.  Police officers jump out their units to engage a target and 50% of them will forget to release the safety.  I have done it myself.  It is a horrible feeling to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.  Not to mention embarassing when theirs 20 other policer officers staring at you!\n\nMy advise is to reconsider arming yourself, especially if you have a family.  There is also a liability issue to consider should you harm someone other than the burglar.  Rounds don't stop at you front lawn!  \nIf you must have a weapon take the responsibility to train and become proficient with it's use regardless of the make and model.  If you choose the glock, leave the first round out of the chamber but keep the magazine loaded.  As far as what caliber, if you goal is to shoot to kill, don't get anything smaller than a .40 cal.  If you want to wound and maybe get lucky and kill em go for a 9mm.\n\nThat's just my opinion!8	why girls are very laiyar?  One of the benefits of a relationship is that we will have someone in our corner to support us and to affirm our existence. This support adds to the trust that is needed in any relationship. Without mutual support, a trusting relationship will not develop. Each member must have its emotional needs met in order to continue to invest in the relationship. The continued support and the being there for the other person emotionally is the way in which trust is developed.8	My friend Dan sorta likes me and I really like him he says he can't go out with me until he gets his grades up  oh-hell-no what type of shit is that maybe he's right he probally wanna be good for you or he might get carried away cause he like what he see.5	What is a snipe hunt?

There is a small mound of tissue just over the eurethra, inside the vagina, which is sensitive to pressure. It has been speculated that this is intended to trigger the final round of contractions when a baby is delivered, because it is exactly where the baby's head presses during final labor. \n\nBut...and perhaps far more useful in the modern world...it also causes those contractions during orgasm, if it has been gently stimulated during sex. \n\nThis causes, in some women, a "push-out orgasm", far more intense than a normal one, in which the vagina contracts harder and farther than normal. \n\nThis was first documented by a doctor named Grafenberg, ergo the name "g-spot".\n\nHere's a website which covers exactly how to find and stimulate the g-spot, and other advanced sexual techniques, in great detail:9	Summons to court but no court seal sent by plantiff not the court.? If the summons to court on a civil case is being persued.  Doesn't the court send out a paper with there seal on it and send it directly to the defendant.  Or does the plantiff just send it regular mail?   But shouldn't it still have the courts seal? All legal documents from the Court is stamped, received, dated and timed.  It should be signed by Clerk of the Court or a Judge.  Most documents, MAINLY summons are served by a Court appointed process server or a sheriff.  It is rarely served via mail.

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. \n\nAnd yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born. The amount of paperwork and the bureaucratic processses and screening involved in government grants make it impossible to get grants in 4 days.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants.

(Dan Cooke, PR)\n\nIn Australia:\n\nVictoria Police spokeswoman Sergeant Creina O'Grady said:\n "No. The Homicide Squad deals in factual evidence not psychic."7	who is your favorite band or singer?  band: greenday or all american rejects\nsinger: eminem or sean paul6	Poor credit. Based on years of ignoring credit report and poor spending choices. Now wiser. How to repair??? I do not qualify for credit cards. Haven't for years. Owe about 50k, about 35k in school loans that are now in collections. License revoked due to judgment about 15 years ago. That one isn't even on my report any more!! Some medical and other, but mostly judgments and school loans, which cannot be discharged with bankruptcy. Still cannot manage money. Each payday, about $30 to $150 in NSF fees. Any suggestions? Unfortunately, your credit will not improve significantly until you get spending under control. Once that's done, you need to start saving SOMETHING so an emergency doesn't kill your effort to establish good credit. Work on paying the most current judgments & collections. Don't close out old accounts. Use ONE charge card monthly for some minor expense and PAY IT ON TIME. Limit credit inquiries, particularly multiples in a short period of time.The rest, unfortunately, takes time. Good luck!7	Do you like any spanish singer/group/band? If yes, who?

Otto von Guericke performed the Magdeburg experiment. He created the Magdeburg hemispheres, which were a pair of large copper hemispheres precisely cast so that their rims fit tightly together. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the resulting sphere contained the world's first artificial vacuum. \n\nGuericke's most famous performance (the Magdeburg Experiment) was carried out on 8 May 1654 before the Emperor Ferdinand III, and attracted crowds from all over Saxony. Before the emperor and a large crowd, Guericke greased the rims of the two hemispheres and carefully fitted them together. Then the local blacksmith began vigorously pumping the air from inside the sealed copper globe. After a while he was joined by his assistants, as the cranking of the pump gradually became more and more laborious.\n\nThe crowd then watched as a team of eight horses harnessed together was led into the square and attached to one hemisphere of the copper globe. Another team of eight horses was then attached to the other hemisphere. At a signal from Guericke, the two teams of horses strained forward in opposite directions, attempting to pull the two hemispheres apart, but no matter how hard they pulled, the horses could not separate the spheres. Guericke told the crowd that all that was holding the hemispheres together was the pressure of the air surrounding them. The vacuum inside the globe meant there was no opposing pressure to balance this great outer force. They were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nClick on the link below, which shows an illustration of the fantastic experiment.\n\nhttp://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/MAGDEB-S.gif\n\nHope this helps!2	can water cause bloating?  Common causes for abdominal bloating are:\n\nOvereating (gastric distension) \nLactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and other food intolerances \nFood allergy \nAerophagia (air swallowing, a nervous habit) \nAlvarez' syndrome, hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without excess of gas in the digestive tract \nIrritable bowel syndrome \nPartial bowel obstruction \nGastric dumping syndrome or rapid gastric emptying \nThe ingestion of some gas-producing foods \nConstipation \nSplenic-flexure syndrome \nMenstruation, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual stress syndrome \nPolycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian cysts \nMassive infestation with intestinal parasites, such as worms (e.g, Ascaris lumbricoides) \nDiverticulosis \nImportant but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include large intra-abdominal tumors, such as those arising from ovarian, liver, uterus and stomach cancer; and megacolon, an abnormal dilation of the colon, due to some diseases, such as Chagas disease, a parasitic infection.\n\nGaseous bloating may be a consequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insuflation of air.\n\nPostmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.\n\nIn some animals, like cats, dogs and cattle, gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.0	What does "Kintaro" mean in Japanese?

Proposed: That from this day forward all non corrective inactive witnesses to unlawful, insulting, verbal, namecalling assualt and or threatenning verbal behavior in disrespect for another human being's civil reasonable behavior would be held fully responsible for that behavior including criminal and civil penalties.  These penalties would consist of criminal and civil damages for the witnessed  threats.  For instance if someone verbally threatenned to kill, they would be sentenced as if the killing was done unless there was formal apology and recognition of their wrongdoing.  If someone witnessed the threats and did nothing about them, they too would pay the piper.

A Hedge Fund is generally structured as a limited partnership having a general partner responsible for the investment activities and day-to-day operation of the fund, and limited partners who are the investors supplying capital but not participating in trading or operations of the fund. The limited partners have limited liability. That is, their exposure to loss is limited to their investment. The General Partner has unlimited liability and is liable for the activities of the partnership. The General Partners principals limit their liability through the use of a corporation or limited liability company as the General Partner. (Of course, the principals cannot limit their liability from the application of the anti fraud provisions of the Federal Securities Laws.) All of the investors’ capital is pooled and is utilized by the General Partner or Investment Manager to implement its trading or investment strategy.1	What's so fascinating about maths?

Part of energy is always used to increase the entropy of the universe as per laws of thermodynamics. Any photon when is absorbed electrons in the pigment that absorbs the photon are energized/ excited. These excited electrons come to the ground level by 1. transferring their energy to other carrier so that ATP is generated. 2. give out the energy as heat energy so that the temperature increases. 3. give out a photon with less energy content i. e. emit light of longer wavelength. It is called fluorescence. What happens depends upon the system.6	what are dream catchers?

If you are to model Light in terms of waves, then, sure it will have its wavelength and frequency, but if u were to model it in terms of particles, then as we know, massless particles do not have wavelengths/frequencies (no De broglie wavelength because there is no mass involved). So how come when finding the enerygy of a particular photon, the equation that we use involves frequency of light? Photons are evil.\n\nRemember how scientists were able to slow down light to 17m/s? If photons were massless, they wouldn't slow down becasue they wouldn't need energy to move in the first place can any amount of energy would propel them at the speed of light.\n\nSo does it mean that photons have very little mass? If so, wouldn't they increase in mass when travelling at the speed of light when energy is converted into mass? \n\nTherefore, photons may have other properties no apparent in the 4 dimensions we live in and have other undiscovered properties in other dimensions.\n\nPhotons are indeed evil...1	Ok...the integral of cos(t^2) is the right question...but its not the whole question?

Sure Bree's is getting some good games in but Brady is coming off a close loss with something to prove; meaning he will own the jets in the pass game. I have a feeling he will have a 3 passing touchdown game with well over 250 passing yards, maybe even 10 yards scrambling up field if the jets get good coverage.9	what will boss's do with army reservists with the new IR laws?  the army wont change any thing5	Where does the 300 yard marker start on a normal track?  the 300 meter marker is at the last straight on the track5	I need a password for presale for wwe in Evansville IN-12/29?

Also, this photo doesn't look like it was taken at night:\nhttp://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1346411.ece\n\nVery interested to see more photos. The earth is bombarded with ~ 1000 metric tons of meteroite PER DAY, so this is not an 'exceptional event' on a global basis.  Remember that 70% of the earth is uninhabited and not under surveillance.\n\nAs to comparing it with 'Hiroshima', this is a typical media exaggeration.  My calculations show that with a 100 kg meterorite traveling at 11000 m/s (the maximum speed it could attain coming from outer space), the energy would be about 1/14000th of the nuclear energy released from the conversion of 0.1 gram of uranium into energy by the Einstein relationship E = mc^24	how do u check if your computer is a dvd burner or a reader?  the front of the dvd drive will either say dvd-rw or dvd-rom. dvd-roms are readers.4	does anyone know how to fix the brightness on a acer laptop? hey i just got this new acer laptop, and i lowered the brightness to check it out, but now it doesnt wannna go up, no matter how many times i have tried. does anyoneknow how to make it stay bright? it will help me a lot. thanks in advanced If it's new or under some kind of warranty, I would try calling tech support if there still is one for Acer. I have seen this once or twice with IBM laptops in the somewhat distant past and the problem is likely in the switch that raises and lowers the brightness. We sent them off for repair. If this is a known issue with Acer, then they may likely repair it free even if it's out of warranty though you would have to pay shippng it there (and get insurance) to the repair center. Hopefully, it isn't he LCD that has gone bad - that can be expensive on a laptop. Also, you might look closely at the keyboard for an Fn (purple lettering maybe) key which will correspond to other purple writing above some of the function keys. There will be one that has some type of sun or light on it that will adjust brightness or dimness, you might tinker with these holding down the Fn key as you repeatedly press the corresponding key. This may be how you dimmed it though - just a thought.

And don't even mention proacvtiv, because my sister used it and it did nothing for her, and i'm allergic to Benzoyl Peroxide. I don't have my periods, and I know when i do it'll get much worse. That's one of the reasons why I really want to get rid of my acne now(Besides the itching and burning). Severe acne often calls for a visit to the doctor.\nTill then use astringent to keep your face clean, cut back on greasy foods, chocolate, and sodas, and double up on the water. Keeping a food/acne  diary can also help you figgure out if it is food caused.6	what personal information is on a california driver licence?

They are taken to a holding cell in the Immigration building, then taken off site to a detention center where they are put in with criminals of all crimes. Then when enough have been gathered together, they send them to the border (of their respected countries) and left there. They are not sent to their individual homes. They wear orange jumpsuits in the detention center and are given their clothes, belongings, and money back when they get to the border. You ARE allowed to take them belongings when they are being detained (such as money and clothing) but you will NOT be able to see them (at least not in the immigration building) If you call and inquire they will give you a time and date that you can talk to them behind glass. They can be bailed out for $5000.00 and given a trial with a judge, but there is no guarantee that the judge will be on their side, they can still be deported. You will get the money back if they attend the court date.8	I am a 16 year old girl with a 15 year old bf. I live in Alaska and he live is Illinois. Should I go see him?  I could understand your urge to meet him, but it may not be a good idea. Guessing you met online, it's quite risky going thousands of miles away to some place alone. Now, if you were visiting with your own folks to IL, ask him to visit and meet your family. Never alone! Just to scare you a li'l more: there are plenty of people (older) who'd assume the fake identity of a 15 year old boy, to allure some 16 year old girl from somewhere else to have her visit him. Kidnapping, rape even murders may occur following that. Well, you get the picture. I know this is awful, but this happens, and many a times unfortunately.2	during sex i experience some kind of blood coming out of my partners vagina,without pain.What is the problem?

Not told so by adults? If you believe in God and so did your parents or other adults, this does not count. My point is that most Christians were TOLD that god exists from the very beginning of their childhood.\n\nHow many of you "found God" as an adult? well even though my parents took me to church every sunday and sunday school and all that, i still found God on my own. When I was 16 I became Pagan and was actively doing that for a few years until one day i got very sick, I had a rare form of strep throat where 1 in 3 people die and i remeber my family praying over me for a week while i was in and out of consciousness until i came out of it and recovered almost immediatly! That next day I was lying in bed and a warm glow surrounded me and I heard God say that He never left my side even though I left Him. I went to church the next sunday and told my pastor and He said "The Lord is my shepard, what more do we need? We are all sheep in his flock and if he has 100 sheep and 1 strays away, He will leave the 99 to bring that 1 back because He never loses one." and after that I knew that He really was my Lord and Savior :)7	AN AWESOME RIDDLe?

Do you believe non-Christians can be saved? I personally do. Please tell me why you believe non-Christians can or cannot be saved.  I appreciate all answers. I believe that it is arrogant to think we know the ways of the Creator.  To say who will or will not be saved by God is simply up to God, surely better company is to be had from a peaceful Buddhist than a whining self rightious door knocker.   The Bible says not to judge others lest we be judged.  I think that tells me more about who will be saved.  \nAlso, even if it tells us that the only way is through Jesus, It's not my job to limit the names, means, and ways, that God opens his paths.0	Hoew do you spell chow (good bye ) in italian?  ciao \n\nc+i or c+e we say it as as the sound in the word CHurCH in english...\n\ngood luck9	Are gay men in the United States exempt from the draft?

Knowing that my trip to work always takes exactly twenty minutes, I realized that I must have looked at the clock in the mirror before I left.\n\nHow many minutes before noon did I leave?\n\n\nWhat I'm looking for is not only the answer but an explanation of how the answer was reached. Whoever can answer correctly will earn twelve points (two for answering and ten for best answer). If you don't know, at least you've earned two points :) You thought you left at 10:55 am, 65 minutes before noon. The clock actually read 1:05 pm, so 20 minutes later you reached work at 1:25 pm, seemingly 2 and a half hours later.\n\nEdit:\nOK, I made a mistake, it could be 65 mins either side of 12 o'clock or 6 o'clock. But as you arrived in the morning it could only be 7:05 am reflected to 4:55 am so you arrive at 7:25 am making the answer 295 mins.\n\nOr 1:05 am reflected to 10:55 pm so you arrive at 1:25 am (less likely working hours) would make the answer 655 mins before noon.9	If you dont with us you  are against us...do you believe in this LAW?  wild law7	Where can i get tickets for sold out gigs ??

Do you mean chikungunya?\nChikungunya is a relatively rare form of viral fever caused by an alphavirus that is spread by mosquito bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The name is derived from the Makonde word meaning "that which bends up" in reference to the stooped posture developed as a result of the arthritic symptoms of the disease. The disease was first described by Marion Robinson[1] and W.H.R. Lumsden[2] in 1955, following an outbreak on the Makonde Plateau, along the border between Tanganyika and Mozambique, in 1952. Chikungunya is closely related to O'nyong'nyong virus[3].\n\nChikungunya is not considered to be fatal. However, in 2005-2006, 77 deaths have been associated with chikungunya on Réunion island.\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of chikungunya include fever which can reach 39 °C, a petechial or maculopapular rash usually involving the limbs and trunk, and arthralgia or arthritis affecting multiple joints which can be debilitating. There can also be headache, conjunctival injection and slight photophobia.1	How do you make a can of coke explode?

By digesting the large molecules into smaller ones, they can be absorbed much more quickly and efficiently.  This lets us get more nutrients out of the food we eat.\n\nAlso, in the case of proteins, the way that amino acids are arranged in proteins doesn't match the arrangement that our body needs for certain things.  The protein is broken down into the amino acids to be absorbed, and then those amino acids can be used to build up proteins that meet the exact specifications that your body needs them to have.3	How can I use the "IF" formulas so it can copy in other cell or worksheets? ie: if a column or row has text/information that will be used in another worksheet or cell. how do I set it up to save time and make sure is the same information.

Her name in Italian means "white", yet, as Iago tells the audience, her name is again "but sign" of purity, as she is in fact "a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes" (Act IV, scene i, ll. 95-96). Ironically, just before Desdemona pleads with Othello that she is not a whore, Bianca too protests to an accuser that she is "no strumpet, but of life as honest/ As you that thus abuse me" (Act V, scene i, ll. 122-123)– leading the audience to realize that, just as with Desdemona, the only evidence anyone has that Bianca is a whore is Iago's word, and Cassio's (he calls her a "customer," whore {Act IV, scene i, l. 120}).\n\nHeaven nevertheless remains a signifier of truth, and hell a signifier of misrepresentation in the play. The words thus recur frequently throughout Othello, as Othello struggles to join other signifiers to them: for example he says to an innocent Desdemona that "Heaven doth truly know that thou art false as hell". This shows strong contrasts between the two.\n\nhttp://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xOthello.html#Othello\nDon't know whether it will help but it is a pretty good guide.3	how can i talk english well as americans . find anyway for that ?  Unfortunately it takes years for most people to become proficient in a second language. Along the way, you should expose yourself to English as much as possible. Watch movies in English with English subtitles or with no subtitles at all. Read as much as you can. Listen to English radio. Speak English at every chance. But keep up with your own language. You cannot be fluent in a second language unless you are advanced in your mother tongue. \n\nBy the way, DannyK5 doesn't know what he is talking about. American English is more standard from one part of the country to another than British English is from one part of the city of London to another. In addition, English spoken in the South is spoken with a Southern accent, but it is generally standard. Have you ever heard of Southern Literature, DannyK5? Now, have you ever heard of Mid-Western Literature? Why do you think that is?5	Crappy Martial Arts School??? A school that gives belt tests that require you do nothing more than perform techniques in the air and katas.\n\nCrap?\n\nThey clain they teach self-defense. But no sparring. Huh?\n\n"Time to renew your one-year contract!" they say.\n\nI don't think so.\n\nWell, I guess it was good exercise, if nothing else.\n\nI'm in my 40s and don't wanna get my face smashed in or broken bones and be unable to work.  \n\nWhat's the best martial art for me for self-defense?\n\nPlease state your experience.\n\nThanks! glad that you realised that you are going to a crappy school.. (some people never do) now that you know what a crappy school looks like and how they are structured, i would just go to various martial arts club in your area ask.. to sit in and watch a lesson or even ask to attend 1 lesson for free... since you have experienced a crap school you'll be pretty aware of what to look out for now and what questions to ask.. ask them about thier grading processes and if they require you to pay any extra fee's for this, does all the equipment get supplied or do you have to purchase your own (big money making scheme for most schools..they should provide you the basic equipment and when you do have to buy something you should have the freedom to get this equipment from anywhere.. not just purchase it from the school only).. ahh whether you have to lock into a 12 month contract (don't) alot can happen in 12 months.. a good school will let you buy a 10 or 20 class pass or let you pay casually or give you the option to sign up in 3 or 6 month blocks.. and a big giveaway look at the type of students which attend the classes.. how competent do they look for their level.. are people that have higher belt ranks overweight.. (they shouldn't be at that level they should be a certain fitness to get to the level they are at, if they are overwieght the belts are obviously getting handed out).. how old are the instrutors?? are they all 18 - 23yrs old another warning there.. they should be  ideally very late 20's or above.. that way you know that your instructor has the adequite knowledge to teach the art.. just some small factors to be mindfull of that will hopefully help when finding a new dojo to train at.. Hopefully you will find a style you enjoy soon.. as for real life effectiveness.. I would look into styles like Brizilian Ju Jitsu, Muay Thai, Krav Maga or the likes..2	Is HIV, herpes, chlamydia, gonnorhea, syphillis, hpv, or crabs worth contracting just to have sex?

I lost my daughter in August 26 and my mother in November 21,I`m having so many different emotions,I don`t know which way to go! I am sorry for your loss. Every one grieves differently and we all feel things in different ways.It sounds like a cliche but time does make it easier and it really does.Take time for yourself to remember the good times and the love shared.Hold the good in your heart to comfort you ,and I believe that death is the beginning of a new journey, not the end.Cry,cry and cry some more ,it does get better ,I know from experience.

I've been pondering this all day since driving into work this morning and having that sneaky stinch find its way into my car.  I don't know what's taken me so long but, I really need to know  why they are here. Skunks are excellent at rodent and insect control and their diet includes black widow spiders and scorpions. Being carrion eaters, they help keep roadways and neighborhoods clean. With their slow, waddling gait and bushy tail, these gentle mammals are delightful to see from a distance, and play an important role in keeping nature in balance - the natural way.2	How many calories do you burn when masturbating?

It is a difficult call because after any pregnancy - whether live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage or abortion, one still sees positive home pregnancy tests for up to eight weeks following the birth or loss. \n\nThe only way to determine if you are in fact pregnant right now would be to ask for a blood test. If your levels are up, you will be asked to return the following week to see if those initial levels have doubled. If that happens, you are pregnant. If the levels stay the same or drop, you may have been recently pregnant again or just have lingering hCG hormone in your bloodstream from your last pregnancy\nhttp://www.anairhoads.org/bc/pregabort.shtml4	Snap Fish photo program?

Film trailers are film advertisements. They are shown before the screening of another movie, at a cinema where the films will be exhibited, as well as in the lobby and on Internet. They are more formally known in theaters as previews of coming attractions. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film programme. Although that practice did not last long, due to patrons tending to leave the theater after the films proper were finished, the name has stuck.4	Question about library in Limewire?

It's called Direct-to-Consumer advertising and it started in 2000.\nIt has been estimated that for the 25 biggest drug companies advertising on TV for every $1 spent in advertising they rake in $4.20 in drug sales...that's a pretty nice profit. It is directly responsible for 12% of the increase in drug sales (2.6 billion)\n\nWhat makes me laugh about the whole thing is half the time they don't actually tell you what a particular drug is prescribed for..then they tell you to call and ask your doctor if it is right for you... can you imagine actually doing that? Hey doc, should i take #$%^&*?....imagine if you ARE a woman and it's for ED!  Boy, would I feel like an idiot....\n\nThe second thing about it is they always list all the complications and side effects that could arise from taking the medication..talk about a turn-off....most of the time I'm sitting there thinking I might just prefer to stay sick  if this stuff could potentially blind me for life, give me a heart attack, or leave me sitting on the toilet for most of the day..(at least..it's a good thing for truth in advertising though)..\n\nI think in general the drugs that are advertised are sending pretty good messages...it probably helps people with depression, ED and cholesterol problems to realize that they aren't alone and that there are ways to fix their problems...I'll tell you what though..if that Bob guy loses his swimming trunks just once more on TV in the middle of the day..I'm going to have to call some kind of ethics committee..tee hee\n\nHope this helped4	How do I know my email has been blocked by the recipient email ?

I think a guy at my workplace might like me romantically but I'm not interested in him. \n\nI'd rather stay friends. We tease each other and act more like a brother and sister than anything. He's taken and edited some embarrassing photos of me and emailed them to the co-workers that we know. (I'm not too angry about that now but I was when he did that!) He'll occasionally ask me to go to the mall or somewhere else with him but I say no. \n\nI don't want to date him; dating to me is very serious and should only be done in view of getting married. I told my mom and she says no; I've asked a guy friend and he reminded me about guys lying about their feelings. \n\nI don't want to hurt his feelings at all. Part of me wants to be honest about the situation but another part thinks that he'd stop being my friend if he did that so I should keep it to myself. I have an idea about what to do but I wanted to put it into Yahoo! Answers and get a wider response.\n\nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK??!!?? WHOA- BABY!  \nI have seen this one before and the first thing that you have to do is stop the teasing!   Teasing can only lead to someone getting hurt!  If this is a good friend then be up front and honest and say \n"I have been teasing you and for that I am sorry.  I still want to be friends", leave it at that and STOP the teasing.  \n\nTrust me some one will get hurt if you don't stop.  I can not guarantee that some one might already be hurt by what has gone on so far.\n\nBest of luck.1	Show that (Σ(from k=1 to n) )1/k =O(log n).?  i could help you but it seems you wrote all your homework here0	Is astral projecting real?

So I told my boyfriend their bragging annoyed me and made me feel bad about all that I DON'T have. He got pissed at me for "JUDGING" his parents and insisted they did nothing wrong. He is still very pissed, and I don't know what to do. Am I wrong? Your wrong to some degree but so is he and so are they.  People tend to be proud of their lives and they most often express that pride to family which is you and your boyfriend.  Yes, they probably carry it too far, but I doubt if it is meant to make you feel bad.  Your boyfriend is wrong because he shouldn't be mad at you.  He should have been understanding and talked you about it.  There was no reason to be mad at you for your feelings regardless of if he believed them or not.1	does raintree bear flowers?  Yes, no doubt about it. The rain tree is an angiosperm plant/tree and hence it bears flower.

The stamens of each flower are numerous, have length greater than the flower it self and attractively colored.They collectively render the flowers very attractive.\nIt is a good avenue tree and planted along the road side for shade.\nIt provides an abode for millions oh very tiny insects.Very often they drench those who take shelter beneath the tree with their liquid droppings and hence the name Rain Tree.1	what is clostridium botulinum and what is recent research related to it, also it's use in biological warfare  Yeah, what he said - almost.

Example:coming home from school and spending 3-5 hours alone. It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.0	many people tell indian way of marriage is really good. can anyone tell why?  who misguided u?\nlol1	If two red heads have children, is there any chance the children will have a hair color other than red?  Yes, it's possible.  \n\nI believe red hair color is a dominant expression of the genes, which can contain either both dominant genes (RR) or one dominant and one recessive gene (Rr).  \n\nSo if both parents have the Rr gene, the the offspring would have 1/4 chances of getting the double recessive genes (rr), and thereby getting the ressive expression of a different (usually lighter) hair color.  \n\nObviously, this is an over-simplification of the human genetics.  See if the bood type checks out.  Or, just get an DNA test to be 99.99% sure.5	Why do the players fight in ice hockey??? What's the point?

Hey! Girl,\n\nIt would be advisable to keep in touch and set a schedule where one would visit the other and vice versa. \n\nBased on my experience back in my college days, I've been dating my ex bf for 5 years since 3rd year high, and when I went to College which is 1 1/2 hour drive from home and stayed in the dorm, we haven't seen each other for quite a while, he sometimes visits me but not so often as he goes to college too or I will go home and have time to visit him. Since my interest changes due to my college experience with my new found friends in the exclusive school for girls, our communication was not quite as often as before. I discovered that he was seeing another girl. After a few years, that relationship didn't even last, until I went abroad to work. After a few years, I came back on a holiday and happen to meet him again but he's already married to someone else. But we're still friends, and we still belong to our circle of friends since high school. I have no regrets for moving on to college, staying in the dorm or going abroad. I improved myself. I keep meeting new friends and sometimes a new boyfriend, but that's just it. Relationship is good while it lasts, it gives me joy and inspiration. \n\nI suggest that you move on with your life and embrace the new experience while you still have your boyfriend at heart. Develop yourself and improve yourself, it's for your own self worth. If he would have time to see you, it means he's committed to you. But if the schedule is kind of hectic at times, keep yourself busy. Don't worry about it, you're still young.\n\nTake care.\n\nMitch4	is it okay to change your answers id/name? does it affect anything? i doubt it4	How to send a sms to a phone number from other country?  this is the only site from where i can send free sms to any country, but it is restricted to 1 sms per day1	What are the advantages/diadvantages of using heavy iron cast skillets vs. lightweight skillets?  There are a whole host of ways that heavy cast iron skillets may be better than (or worse) than using a lightweight skillet, but given that this is probably a question that wants you concentrate of physical properities of materials  I will limit my comments to that area.\n\nA heavy cast iron skillet has more MASS than a lightweight skillet of any kind. Therefore it will heat up more slowly and transfer changes in heat less rapidly. This may be an advantage when cooking foods that one wants evenly browned/seared, as those kinds of task require lots of even heat. This same "slow to heat & cool" property might be a disadvantage when trying to quickly boil or evaporate liquid. It would also be a disadavantage when trying cook delicate foods quickly, as in making candy, where precise temperatire control helps to prevent overcooking.\n\nFurther, uncoated cast iron is chemically reactive -- it will rapidly oxidize/rust and so must be coated with oil to prevent it from deteriorating. Even using it to cook foods that are acidic (such as tomatoes or vinegar) will also cause chemical interactions.8	GIRLS ARE SUCH A PAIN!!

I can see it all ending in tears in years to come.\nGreat Britain is Christian, yet all christians now have to celebrate almost in private, I dont get that, but then I dont get what the Labour Party is trying to acheive either. If it is to alienate the British public and divide communities then they are doing a grand job. If it was to unite a mult-cultural Britain then they have failed in style.\nOn the same hand, the methods of the BNP are not right either.\nI would only hope that someone somewhere in power gets a grip and actually talks to the people rather than sitting in their Ivory towers thinking they know what is right. There was a thing called common sense, I believe it is now called the opposite.5	roller blade trails in Beaverton, OR?  It is a beautiful day today!

I work with MDs and have had the same problem in the past.  The orthopedic surgeon I work with as well as one of the general surgeons told me that plantar warts need air, and occasional light as well as moisture to "grow".  They told me to cover them with a piece of duct tape and keep them covered so they get no light or air and if it comes off in the shower to replace it as soon as you get out.  I tried it and it worked for me, just takes a while.7	What’s the link B/w Queen of the Stone Age and California?  yeah, their from california and they've recorded there for a long time.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was the peace treaty that ended the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). The treaty provided for the Mexican Cession, in which Mexico ceded 1.36 million km² (525,000 square miles) to the United States in exchange for USD$15 million. The United States also agreed to take over $3.25 million in debts Mexico owed to American citizens.\n\nThe cession included parts of the modern-day U.S. states of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Wyoming, as well as the whole of California, Nevada, and Utah. The remaining parts of what are today the states of Arizona and New Mexico were later ceded under the 1853 Gadsden Purchase. he treaty was signed by Nicholas P. Trist on behalf of the United States and three plenipotentiary representatives of Mexico on February 2, 1848, at the Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo (today Gustavo A. Madero, D.F.), slightly north of Mexico City. NNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!6	Can you answer this?

I was wondering how people who believe in the bible and the 10 commandments have made an exception to "thou shall not kill?  I think thats a fairly straightforward commandment. First of all the Bible does not say thou shalt not kill. It says thou shalt not commit murder, and there is a vast difference. Secondly the same Bible that says thou shalt not commit murder also says whosoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed. Also the same law that the ten commandments is in teaches clearly the death penalty for murder and several other crimes as well including rape, blasphemy, etc. We Christians don't make up our own religion we follow what the Bible taught. You misquote our Bible, that I don't think you have ever read, and then use your misquote to try and refute us. Read the Bible yourself before you throw it at us.1	how do I create an ant colony? I think this could be a cool project. Its not easy as you will need to obtain a queen ant before you can start the colony. Making the nest is easy just a perspex box with soil in, make it about 3 inch wide but it needs to be big, they will make there own channels & you can see them in the box living there life.Plus you need a food source. Depends on what type of ants you gets, Ants can be herbivores & Carnivores.So best to try & get leaf cutter ants or something.5	Who was the the most gifted snooker player of all time? snooker I think John Virgo was a good player, he must have been good to be still commentating on TV now!3	Can you have a Stafford Loan coming from more than one place for college?  You can use a different lender from year to year.  For example, you can obtain your Freshman year Stafford Loan from Citizens Bank and your Sophomore year Stafford Loan from Citibank.  You will find that this is a little bit of a pain since it will entail completing a new Master Promissory Note for each lender (and might confuse your school a little bit if they are expecting you to borrow from once place and you go elsewhere).  \n\nHaving multiple lenders can benefit you, though, if you plan on consolidating later. See, students who borrow every single student loan from the same lender are bound by something known as the "single holder rule." Simply put, this rule states that a students with loans help by a single lender *must* consolidate with that lender.  So, if all your loans are with Citibank, you must consolidate with Citibank, even if Sallie Mae is offering better borrower benefits.\n\nNow, you probably shouldn't attempt to borrow from two Stafford lenders during the same enrollment period at the same school (for example, if you were awarded $3,500 as a Sophomore, you shouldn't attempt to borrow $1,750 from Citibank and $1,750 from Sallie Mae). While this isn't expressly forbidden, it's... well, weird and could cause a big mess (you could be responsible for an overpayment, your loan disbursements could be delayed, etc.). \n\nKeep in mind that interest rates on Stafford Loans are set by the federal government, so your underlying interest rates on any Staffords will be the same. The only reason you'd want to "shop around" would be to obtain one of the many "borrower benefits" out there for student loan borrowers (interest rate reductions, principal reductions, etc.).  However, it's unlikely that one bank will offer a benefit that's enormously better than another bank's benefit (the borrower benefits will be different, yes, but in the end, they tend to add up to similar savings).  \n\nFor more information about borrower benefits and about the "single holder rule," which is still in effect, check out these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/singleholderrule.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/choosing.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/calculators/loananalyzer.phtml9	Why do they allow people like Michael Bloomberg to buy their way into office.?

I am a dental assistant and someone who had dry socket. It is very painful but your dentist should of given you pain medication. Dry socket is when you have problems clotting in the effected area. The dentist should be putting medication on gauze and putting it in the hole were the tooth was removed. You should do this every couple of days and the dentist should change the dressing and put new ones in your mouth. This will help you heal. When ever you get bottom teeth pulled it hurts more because of the bone. The medication he puts in should give you relief from pain. Do not take aspirin because it thins your blood and you will blood more. Take motrin, or my favorite is advil liquid gels. It works great. Make sure you eat soft foods and not to hot because it will irritate the area. You will feel alot better once you get the medication in the effected area.4	what is CDEX? may be a softwsre CDex is an application that records audio tracks from CDs and saves them to a disk as regular WAV files or as encoded sound files.

How do I find her to pay for my car damage? (Estimate damage is $1211.47) I live in North Carolina Hi, Did you get her license plate number off of her vehicle?  If so, you should be able to track down the vehicle through the department of motor vehicles, if your state allows it.  If you have no luck there, it sounds like you have a situation where you may need to file a small claim suit against her which should cost you around $100 and you can ask the judge for reimbursement for this amount (providing you can at least get her mailing address to file with).  If not, sounds like you are stuck with paying for your own repair.

I am studying for a big final and I need help with the following problems:\nPlease help me choose the right answer\n---------------------------------------------\n1.Which of the following would express the approximate density of carbon dioxide gas at 0°C and 2.0 atm pressure(in grams per liter)?\na.) 2g/L\nb.) 4g/L\nc.) 6g/L\nd.) 8g/L\ne.) none of the above\n----------------------------------------------\n2. The combustion of carbon monoxide yields carbon dioxide. The volume of oxygen gas needed to produce 22 grams of carbon dioxide at STP is\na.) 4.0 liters\nb.) 5.6 liters\nc.) 11 liters\nd.) 22 liters\ne.) 32 liters\n---------------------------------------------------\n3. If the average velocity of a methane molecule, CH4, is 5.00x10^4 cm/sec at 0°C, what is the average velocity of helium molecules at the same temperature and pressure conditions?\na.) 2.5x10^4 cm/sec\nb.) 5.0x10^4 cm/sec\nc.) 1.0x10^4 cm/sec\nd.) 2.0x10^4 cm/sec\ne.) 5.0x10^4 cm/sec 1. Through some re-working of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, you can get M = (dRT)/P where M is the molecular mass, d is the density, and R is the gas constant, 0.08206. Plug in your values, minding tempurature must be in K and solve for d. I got 3.9, rounding give 4 g/L or b.\n\n---------------\n\n2.First you have to balance the combustion reaction CO + O2 => CO2. So you'd have a 1/2 in front of the O2, and that should be it. Then you just convert 22 grams of CO2 into moles of CO2 and use the balanced reaction coefficients to see how many moles of O2 you will need (i.e. divide the number of CO2 moles by 2 to get O2 moles) thenjust plug everything into PV = nRT again and solve for V. I got 5.6 L or b.\n\n---------------\n\n3. Although there are alot of ways to do this, the way I do it is like this. R1/R2 = SQRT(M2/M1) where R is the speed of each molecule in question and M is the molecular mass. Notice how the order changes on each side of the equation - this is not a mistake. so you just plug everything in and solve for R2 (or R1 depending on how you set it up). I got 2.5 E 4 or a. Also, just in case, SQRT means Square Root.8	How to know guy is interested in you? Jsut a general question... It varies depending on the guy's personality. Guys who are super-egotistical will start hitting on you as soon as they see you, and in an overt and obnoxious way. Guys who have a balanced amount of self esteem and self confidence will try to srike up a conversation with you about some subject. They will have more respect for you as a person and not simply look at you as a piece of meat. And finally there are those guys who are very shy and nervous around women, and they will try to hide their interest in you but you'll be able to detect it. These guys need to work on their self confidence and usually they will if they are really attracted to you.1	Why does squinting your eyes help you see better? When you dont have your glasses or contact lenses in - why does squinting help you see better? Squinting utilizes the muscles that control the lens and your eye. By squinting you are chaging the focal length of the lens and the physical shape of your eyeball. The muscles are actively compensating for the defect in your vision. It is hard to maintain this level of visual acumen and it is very  tiring, hence the reason people wear glasses or contacts. But small defects can be overcome with squinting for brief periods. This is also the school of thoght behind the vision repair methodology. They claim to be able to teach you to use your muscles to correct vision deficiencies. While minor problems can be corrected with rertraining muscles, any substantial changes to the shape of the eye or the position of the lens is too straining for muscles alone and laser surgery, glasses or contacts are needed.6	what do you have to do to become an editor? eg- what courses do you have to take in university? \nwhat experiences do you have to have?\netc...

He will do this on his second visit here.\n\nWhere in the Old Testament, not the New Testament, does it predict that the Messiah will make two trips to get everything done?  The Messiah may be described as having a dual role- redemption from sin, and a physical kingdom on earth, but where does it say he has to do this in 2 trips here? My question to you is where does it say that he does NOT do it in two trips. God sent his Son as a gift of salvation but if some don't accept this gift then why should they expect to reap the benefits of His gift. The Messiah is not coming back to "Fix what he did wrong the first time". The Messiah is coming back the second time to take all of us that have accepted his glorious gift back with him to spend eternity in Glory. And just so that you know, for those of us that have accepted this awesome gift, we do have peace. It is those that do not want to accept it that can't experience the peace that he brought the first time, but it is never too late to accept His gift and begin living with the peace and happiness that so many of us have! You're in my prayers.3	famous african american inventor?  I don't know which one your looking for but here's a few(they are all famous in my book).\n\nMcCoy, Elijah\nElijah McCoy (1843 or 1844-1929) was a mechanical engineer and inventor. McCoy's high-quality industrial inventions (especially his steam engine lubricator) were the basis for the expression "the real McCoy," meaning the real, authentic, or high-quality thing. \n\nMorgan, Garrett\nGarrett Augustus Morgan (March 4, 1877 - August 27, 1963), was an African-American inventor and businessman. He was the first person to patent a traffic signal. He also developed the gas mask (and many other inventions). Morgan used his gas mask (patent No. 1,090,936, 1914) to rescue miners who were trapped underground in a noxious mine. Soon after, Morgan was asked to produce gas masks for the US Army.\n \nRillieux, Norbert\nNorbert Rillieux (March 17, 1806-October 8, 1894) was an African-American inventor and engineer who invented a device that revolutionized sugar processing. Rillieux's multiple effect vacuum sugar evaporator (patented in 1864) made the processing of sugar more efficient, faster, and much safer. The resulting sugar was also superior. His apparatus was eventually adopted by sugar processing plants all around the world. \n\nWalker, Madame C. J.\nMadame C. J. Walker (December 23, 1867 - May 25, 1919) was an inventor, businesswoman and self-made millionaire. Sarah Breedlove McWilliams C. J. Walker was an African-American who developed many beauty and hair care products that were extremely popular. Madame Walker started her cosmetics business in 1905. Her first product was a scalp treatment that used petroleum and a hot comb. Sarah later invented a system for straightening hair. She added Madame to her name and began selling her new "Walker System" door-to-door. Walker soon added a hair-growing ointment and other cosmetic products to her line. The products were very successful and she soon had many saleswomen, called "Walker Agents," who sold her products door to door. \n\nTo learn more click below:3	Compare and contrast the techniques of "Clay" and "Cat in the rain" that the narrators employ  Let me repeat it even louder--DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK!4	how do you convert a wma file to a file for an ipod?  you get a converter that changes wma to mp3.4	Mozilla browser problem...Need advice?

I had this same problem.  Look if you want to know the answer you got, you need to play the game.  The game will be to act or if you really want, be interesting in joining the military.  You didnt take the ASVAB because you were not somewhat interested correct?  \n\nGo to the recruiters office of your choice and ask them.  They will have all the answers, and if not they will know where to find the answers.  Be prepared before you go. \n\nTHe recruiter has a job to do and that is to get you to join the military.  If you tell them you are not interested in joining, but only to know your score they will hit you up with lots of questions and what not.  If you tell them you are somewhat interested then they will give you the information you want.  \n\nJust a heads up, I wouldnt join any branch unless you score over 50, this will guarantee you that you can possibly get a job that you want.  Those who score less are at the mercy of the recruiter when it comes to lookign for jobs.  Imagine from "Full Metal Jacket"  Private Pile probably scored a 25 or 30, that is why they said "Pile 0-600 infantry, you made it!"  You dont want to be private Pile.  However dont let the recruiters mess with you, time is on your side and if you want to take the ASVAB 30 times, that is your right.  Just keep requesting to take it until you get the score you want.  Usually a 65-75 will guarantee you any job you want.1	I need some example of conductors? Inmy homework I need to draw examples of conductors and insulators, could anyone help?

The Rules of Play\n\nThe Rules may be placed into two generic groups, those which infringe only a rule of play and are called minor rules. Those which infringe the rights of an opponent are called major rules.\n\nThe minor rules, such as "stepping", "breaking", "over a third", "held ball" and "offside" are all penalised with a free pass to the opposing team. The major rules, consistign mainly of intimidation, contact, obstruction and discipline are all penalised with a penalty pass or penalty pass or shot to the opposing team. On infringing a major rule, the guilty offender must stand out of play until the ball has left the thrower's hands. \n\n\nNetball positions\nPosition Name Abbreviation Opponent Areas permitted\nGoal Shooter GS Goal Keeper Attacking goal third including goal circle\nGoal Attack GA Goal Defence Attacking goal third, goal circle, and centre third\nWing Attack WA Wing Defence Attacking goal third and centre third, not goal circle\nCentre C Centre Everywhere except goal circles\nWing Defence WD Wing Attack Defensive goal third and centre third, not goal circle\nGoal Defence GD Goal Attack Defensive goal third and centre third, including goal circle\nGoal Keeper GK Goal Shooter Defensive goal third, including goal circle2	Why is it that every time I go to bed with any itchy butt I wake with stinky fingers????

A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint.\n\nCartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin.2	How can I prevent my Asthma from acting up so frequently while still on my regular medication? The question is sort of self-explanitory Hi Sentaka\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal your condition.\n\nCause: \nAsthma is caused by malnutrition. Only by diligent and consistent effort to change embedded habits will one get permanent relief. The cough is a result of nature's effort to expectorate mucus from the lungs, after which breathing becomes easier. Ofttimes the cause of asthma is basically a nervous condition because the nerves are irritated \n\nHerbal Aids: \n1. Convulsions: When a person is in a convulsion there are certain herbs that will give very fast relief. One of these is tincture of lobelia, and a valerian decoction with a little cayenne added to relieve spasms. If such an attack comes after a meal one should use an emetic, such as a large dose of lobelia or use the Yoga finger method. (see # 2 below) \n\n2. Yoga Finger Method: Drink several cups of warm water, then place the middle finger deep down the throat and press the tongue until regurgitation starts. Mustard is also good to clean the stomach and lungs. Prior to the emetic a peppermint or spearmint tea should be used to soothe the area and alleviate the discomfort of continual vomiting. Hot fomentation of castor oil, comfrey, lobelia, mullein, etc., may be placed over the stomach, liver, spleen and lung areas. Frequent hydrotherapy baths or lengthy sweat baths are beneficial, followed by a cold shower or sponging. \n\n3. Vapor Bath: Another helpful method is to take a vapor bath twice a week, inhaling steam from a decoction of cudweed ragwort, wormwood, or a decoction of the following herbs, taken warm, (equal parts) will prove very beneficial: elecampane root, horehounds, hyssop, skunk cabbage root, vervain, wild cherry bark (and to this preparation add tincture of lobelia or antispasmodic tincture. Clear the bowels with an injection of catnip or barberry bark. This affliction also calls for plenty of outdoor exercise, deep breathing, and good ventilation while sleeping. The whole body system should be built up with tonic herbs such as chickweed, comfrey, marshmallow, mullein, etc. Diet should be mostly fruits and vegetables, avoiding all processed devitalized foods. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Herbal Respiratory Formula: (Resp-Free) It is wonderful for asthma. This combination of herbs in tablet, tea and capsule form is an aid to relieve irritation in the respiratory tract--lungs and bronchial. This is an aid in Emphysema as well as other bronchial and lung congestion such as bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, etc. Suggested amount for an adult is a cup two or three times a day, or 2 or 3 capsules or tablets two or three times a day with a cup of comfrey tea. For additional help in the program, it is good to add three to six drops of tincture of lobelia to each cup of tea. This formula consists of comfrey root, mullein, chickweed, marshmallow root and lobelia. \n\n5. Dr. Christopher's Hay Fever Formula: (Sha Tea) It is good for asthma also. This combination is a natural herbal aid working as a decongestant and antihistamine to dry up sinuses and expel from the head and broncho pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. Combine this with the respiratory combination to speed up the process. The wise person will turn to fresh wholesome food and beverages to keep the body in a perfect state. This will guarantee permanent relief, by going to the cause. \n\n6. Elder: The inner bark is used, although it should be aged before used. The fresh bark is violently irritating and poisonous to children. It is specifically used for spasmodic asthma with copious phlegm and stringy mucus. For asthma, take a tablespoonful whenever an attack threatens. Powdered Cloves can alleviate excessive vomiting when using the bark. To avoid bowel cramps, add a tablespoonful of powdered Ginger to the infusion. (ShoA:58). \n\n7 Lobelia: Most people agree that Lobelia is a specific treatment for asthma, as well as other bronchial or spasmodic troubles. Because the herb removes obstructions, g8	How can you have more time together?

Have you ever seen my house?Stuff scattered in front, behind and hither and yon. I suppose I keep house the way I keep my stories. "Hither and yon." Of course I've always been a little "left of center," so that might be the answer I need to give. I had amazingly hilarious stories of my high school days. College? oh lord could you blackmail me with some of those!! But the groovy cool part is that weird outlandish things still happen to me all of the time. I had this friend that I used to talk to every day. I swear I think he wanted to just hear me ramble about all of the strange happenings in my life just that he could feel a bit more normal. So hopefully more and more strange and unusual and exciting and exasperating stories will continue to occur.

I have seen a picture of a elephant seal that died in the tundra over 300 years ago  and it is still not decomposed.1	how is the kidney of a desert rat, a beaver or a dolphin different to that of a humans? biology work, any ideas?

Long loops generate a very high solute concentration relative to general body tissues and this promotes the reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate.\nA desert rat has very long Loops of Henle.\nI'll let you work out the rest!1	whats electromagnetism and how does it relate to batteries?

Yes and No.\n\nFor the average user, the new MacBook Pro offers faster startup time and many applications that are designed for the new (to Apple) Intel processor that will run faster than before.  \n\nThis is one side of the story.  Many computer users choose Apple for use in design projects ranging from graphics to film editing.  Applications like Apple's own Final Cut Pro, Motion, and non Apple programs like Photoshop (Macromedia)  will most likely run faster on the older Powerbook G4s because they are not written to work natively with Intel processors.  This does not mean these programs will not work on the MacBook Pro, they will just run slower because they require a special (invisible) program to allow them to run on the Intel processor.  \n\nFor the average user, however, the MacBook Pro is well worth it.8	Do you believe in fate that if you let somene go & if that person is for you then they will come back?

My mom has talked to my dad since my grandpa has gotten worse with the names and my dad says he will talk to him but I dont think he will;; because he hasnt yet and he says 'its just teasing'. Well even if it is just teasing; it makes me feek horrible and upset and annoyed. And no one in my family does anything about it! They just let him do it!! \n\nWHAT DO I DO??????\nI've just been calling him names back but I usually get yelled at! What should I do??? Please help me!! wear earplugs whenever you get in hearing distance of him and just smile wide, and if you see his lips moving, just say "I think you are too.", either way it has to be a positive comment or an annoying but powerful comeback.\n\nanother approach is to avoid him & ignore him until he realises that he is not wanted. he will leave you alone, and if he starts calling you names tell him that you have bettter things to do than listen to him time-consuming lectures on your own inferiority. old people get pissed off when you use big words.\n\nalso, you might want to group together with your mom to solve the problem, because she has power in the household, and both of you together might convince your dad to talk to your grandfather. \n\ni hope this advice helps because i have the exact same problem, i don't get what it is but grandfathers on your dad's side are really mean to you some times if you are a girl. Hope this helps! Good Luck!2	how successful is inuterine insemination?  I think it all depends on the person.

Absolutely positively not.  You're probably better off not messing up your head with what you're told in Church, but rather learn on your own.  You have access to the same exact book that all Christianity is based on and since there are well over 30,000 religions claiming to follow that book, all with different ideas, which one are you going to pick anyway? They do want you throwing money in the bowl though, so they might use the guilt thing to get you to join and stay with a particular church.6	Can just anyone obtain my credit report?  Obtaining someone elses credit report without permission is a federal offense.  That said, it used to be as easy as knowing your SSN and birth-date.\n\nNowadays, it is a little more tough.  Online Credit agencies will ask several security questions that are not easy to answer.\n\nFor example, they might say something like:\n "Which of the following accounts did you close in 1999:"\n   "a) Sears"\n   "b) Home Depot"\n   "c) Chase"\n   "d) Citibank"\n\nThere are a series of these questions, whatever they know from your SSN, they can ask for, addresses, accounts, etc.\n\nNow, somebody like a spouse in an ongoing divorce can easily know all that information and obtain a credit report.  However, even this inquiry will show up on the credit report.  If you pull it yourself, you could see that someone else got it (not always easy to read).\n\nIn the case I mentioned of a spouse in a divorce  it is hard to tell what the authorities would do.  It would likely not be investigated, and it depends on the state and judge.  If there was an order to respect the others privacy, it would at least be contempt of court.\n\nBut again:\n  - every time your credit-file is pulled, there is a entry made (stays for 3 months)\n  - it is a federal offense, if you think someone got it against your will, call the agency you got your report from and ask for an investigation.\n  - Last but not least, all your creditors are allowed to pull your credit on a regular basis9	I have to pay my ex-wife half of my retirement and I want no contact from her ever. I need answers about this?  I am going to assume that the court ordered divorce decree establishes this in writing.  Because the UCMJ only gives this as an option  it is NOT automatic, NOR is it guarentedd to be 50% of retirement pay.  It is a percentage, but each states's divorce laws are different.  \n\nIf you are not already divorced, get thee hence to a civilian lawyer well versed in military law.  If you are already divorced, then unless you can get the decree changed, I am not sure there is much you can do.8	hey ! can I get away from a girl, who is after my life and wants to marry me?

Most definitely, unless you learn how to view the Stats from your media player. In Real Player or Windows Media Player, for example, you can see statistics that include the url of where the broadcast is being streamed from. However, this won't always tell you who the broadcaster is. You'll also have to look at the copywrite information.1	Chemistry help? Which color has the shortest wavelength and which color has the longest wavelength? Red has the longest. Violet is the shortest.\n \nJust remember the ROYGBIV. Use the splitting of white light into rainbow colors method where light splits up  as white light contains all the seven colors. In this experiment, the red light bends least in the prism while the voilet bends most as it travels slower.\n\nThe longer the wave length the faster it travels and the shorter the wavelength the the slower it travels. Because of this, we can deduce that red has the longer wavelength and violet has a longer wavelength.\n\nSorry, I am not in the right mind.

She has had severe indometriosis this was cleaned up also. The chances are still good that she will get pregnant. The concern would be more if she will successfully carry a pregnancy. Once women get scarred with things such as endometriosis or infections, they are more likely to have ectopic pregnancies (pregnancies that happen outside the uterus). These are pregnancies which can not be sustained as they will do severe harm to the mother, even death if untreated. And the pregnancy would not survive past the first few weeks anyway. I am not saying she will have this problem, but it is a possibility.2	toronto eglinton/yonge women's help organization?  Need to know what type of women's help organization.

This mean that his first prioority is to do something with his relationship. Maybe he is not sure if he wants to break up with his girlfriend!

I demonstrates the duality of wave/particle beahviour that characterises the Universe.\n\nIt is easier to do with electrons.\n\nIf you take two slits, and shine a light at them you will see a diffraction pattern beyond the slits, because the light waves alternately interfere constructively and destructively. \n\nThe same happens with electrons. Which shows that they behaves like waves.\n\nBut with electrons, you can arrange to fire them one at a time at the slits. So how on earth can they interfere? But the pattern seen to develop over time is precisely what is expected with the wave theory.1	if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound.?  no, but if an idiot falls near by the trees laugh at him4	Does adobe photoshop  cs2 have the "photo mosaic" feature?

The courts are overruling the votes of the people.  The Congress will not turn the important issues over to the people so that we can decide.  When our voice is heard we are told that it is unconstitutional.  When we try to ammend the constitution so that it may become constitutional we are told NO.  Does the government reflect the will of the people or FEAR it? They do, for the most part, care what the people think, because the people are the ones that will keep them in office. However, when it comes to decision making votes, you must understand that we, the people, do not have all of the information on the issues that they do. \n\nAlot of the things that will influence their decisions are things that we are not allowed to know about because of security issues. That is why it is important that we elect people to office that we feel confident with. They need to be intelligent people who seem to think along the same lines that we do. After all, we are the ones that put them in office to begin with. \n\nAnd if you don't vote...don't complain! Frequently I have found that the people who complain about the government the most did not even vote in the last elections. We vote on everything, from the city level to the federal level. And those who do not express their opinions by their vote should have no reason to complain.2	my 2 girls where playin with my nail polish (black)? they have nail polish  in her hands, legs,how do i remove it.

There are reasons, and mainly they have to do with power supply kicking off, pulling a lot of current and then your hard drive spin up. They are using air as bearings for the drive, so they float when running but when off sit metal on metal. \n\nIt is like starting a car, a lot of things are happening and typically that is when a car fails. \n\nAlso, if you mean just rebooting all the time, that is because windows creates virtual memory allocations of your hard drive for swap memory. These tend to get fragmented and take up a lot of memory if you just power off without shutting down. If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves.0	You are everything, the beginning, the end, the biggest, the smallest, you create galaxies?

I should hate him, but I don't.?  because real love is eternal. you shouldn't hate him, but you can't be with him. you love him because of who he is, not because of what he does. i've never been abused, but i've been in a bad relationship. i still love her, but i can't be with her because of what she does. there's no rhyme or reason to explain who you love, but just because you love them doesn't always mean a happy ending. you need to continue to love him, but move on with your life. it's tough, but it can be done. i'm proof.8	i want to divorce my husband what should i do?

"Don" starring : Amitabh / SRK... Chhota Rajan and his wife are already in Indian jail caught by the Mumbai police, where as Dawood Ibrahim is taking asylum in Pakistan. He is  in Karachi and Indian Police have no jurisdiction beyond India. What we see in Indian movies is not even 10% reality. if the cinema heroes try to be 'Don' in real life they will land up in jail the next moment. Police in India is not as bad as they are projected through movies. They have solved very tough cases whenever they have wanted. It is the politicians who create problems for handling cases in accordance with law.

WHY IS THE OCEAN BLUE?\nSunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Some of the sunlight is reflected off the surface of the water, reflecting the color of the sky. Some of the sunlight penetrates the water and is scattered by ripples and particles in the water (this tinges the appearance of the ocean with the color of the particles). In deep water, much of the sunlight is scattered by the oxygen in the water, and this scatters more of the blue light. \n\nWater absorbs more of the red light in sunlight; the water also enhances the scattering of blue light. Sir Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman (an Indian physicist) won the Nobel prize in 1930 for his work on light. \n\n\nSome Oddly-Colored Seas:\nThe Red Sea often looks red because of red algae that live in this sea. \nThe Black Sea looks almost black because it has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide (which appears black).1	do Hummingbirds really Hum?  yes, they do really hum with there wings of course.

Has anyone ever tried the LA Weightloss and help are there any tips you could give me??? I managed an La Weight Loss center for 4 years until I married last year. Yes LAWL does work but so do alot of other programs. The key with LAWL is Lifestyle change!!! You must be willing to make lifelong changes not temporary ones and the program will work. Let me see what tips I can give you.... Write down everything you eat, this sucks, but truly helps and this is a big part of LA program. Also eat often and never forget breakfast. Watch portions- especially starches and certain proteins. Eat veggies and fruits everyday. Stay away from processed foods, carry water with you everywhere and stop eating 2 hours before bedtime.

If through immigration and interracial marrages you found that you had "native American" blood but also found that the "nation/tribe" that you are claiming to be from did not recognize you because your bloodline was to diluted, would you still claim to be "Native american" or even part? Well, this is kind of an issue with some tribes.  The BIA has made rules about who can be recognized, usually you have to have at least 25% blood to be a tribe member.  Some people who are say, half Arapaho and half Cherokee or something have to choose WHICH tribe they can claim to be.  Tribes which would traditionally adopt members are not allowed to do so.  \n\nWhat that boils down to is that legally, unless you're a quarter whatever, you can't claim to be any tribe.  But I would say you could point out that you have part of that bloodline, and be proud that you can trace your heritage.\n\nOh, and a lot of us "Irish" in the states say that because we've only been here three or four generations and tend to marry other Irish families.

There is no way that you will ever be able to satisfy 100% of the people 100% of the time. You have to look at your beliefs and your ethics and values. Usually listening to the inner voice is a huge key. One thing that I have learned is to breathe - I know that this sounds silly, but it does work. The fact that you are able to stop your "emotional" flow to take a minute to focus on inhaling and exhaling allows your "logical" side to have control, even if it's just long enough for a breath. Physically, the inhalation of air will feed your brain cells. You will be less likely to overreact. \n\nYou will be happier with yourself if you do take a moment. You will be able to react in a way more in tune with your beliefs, and the difficult person may not be as bothersome.\n\nAnother thing I have always lived by is LEAPS\n  L      Listen\n  E      Empathize\n  A      Apologize\n  P      Positive Phrasing\n  S      Solution\n\nListen - to what the person is saying - sometimes all they need is to say what their issue is.\n\nEmpathize - No one has a situation that is so far removed from the norm that someone else can not relate to it. \n\nApologize - Chicago was right - sometimes it really is hard to say I'm sorry, but it is totally worth it.  And look at it this way, even if you are not sorry for what happened, you are sorry that it has caused a negative reaction.\n\nPositive Phrasing - Quote the Beatles (can ya'll tell I was a music major yet???  LOL)  We can work it out!  Every problem has a solution. It may be that the difficult person and you have no more interaction, but it is solved.\n\nSolution - Look at the root and discuss an option for solution. \n\nMost problems are not really issues, they are lacks of communications. People don't listen anymore and we as a society have learned to that it's not worth the time to communicate; because our heart felt emotions fall on deaf ears when we try.  Be committed to listening.\n\nI hope this helps - e-mail me and let me know!\n\nLeigh-lee1	Statistics Homework?

What is the probability that the democrats will win and the bill will pass? you are trying to find the probability that democrats win, and the bill passes.  Let A be the event that the demos win, and B be the event that the bill passes.

The above answer is correct with respect to human anatomy. However, the shoulder girdle of most vertebrates has more bones. \nIn most vertebrates, there is one important bone dorsal to the glenoid cavity (the place where the humerus articulates), that's the scapula. \nThere's another important bone ventral to the glenoid cavity, the coracoid. \nFor instance, in an amphibian there are well developed scapulae (with a suprascapular cartilage) and coracoids; and claviculae (ventral, situated anterior to the coracoids). The claviculae and the coracoid connect the shoulder girdle with the sternum.\nReptiles have many variations including other bones (interclavicula, etc.)\nBirds have strong scapulae and coracoids, and the claviculae fused in a furcula.\nPrototherian mammals (platypus and echidnas) have a reptilian-like shoulder girdle; marsupials and eutherians only have scapula, because the coracoid has fused to it forming the "coracoid apophysis". The clavicle may be present or absent; it's usually well developed in animals that use their forelimbs for different movements (for instance climbing, manipulating food) and reduced or absent in others that are specialized for running.4	who is denis ritchi?

I know you are on the shorter side, but 80 pounds is still too thin for you.  You should talk to your parent(s) about going to see a doctor, and have your doctor tell you what a good weight for you is.  Then you can think about getting your buddy.\n\nAn in-person buddy is much better for this kind of thing - someone who can get together and exercise with you, hold you accountable for eating good things, you can learn how to cook healthy together, etc.  Maybe your school nurse or counselor can put you in touch with a good buddy "candidate."\n\nMarina, listen:  Junior high is a scary place, and some people there are at the height of meanness.  You could go in to junior high weighing 19  pounds, and someone will still call you FAT.  Getting down to a certain weight is NOT going to protect your heart and soul from the mean people in your life.  The people who are mean will find something to insult you for, true or false.\n\nThe trick you have to learn has nothing to do with weight loss.  You have to learn how to block those mean comments out of your brain, to not let them in and not let them bother you.  Find a friend in your life - in person - to stick close to and support you when you get to junior high, and start practicing now how to ignore the people who call you fat, ugly, stupid, whatever.  Those people are worthless, and their comments have no value unless you give them value by allowing them to change YOUR behavior.  If you let those haters hurt your feelings, and let them make you think you need to weigh 80 pounds, then they win.  Don't let that happen.2	wht is the right position for sitting long time when on work, precautions to avoid piles(heomeoheriods)?

I have had two types of reoccuring dreams since I was a little girl and I was wondering if anyone could give me any insight on what they might mean and why I am still having them.\nFirst, I keep dreaming of sharks. When I was little the sharks in the dreams were no threat but the older I have gotten the more menacing they've become. Now it is one big shark, always the same exact shark.\nThe second dream is where I am in this huge old house, Like an old mansion. I can't get out of the house and there is this entity after me, and I am not talking normal ghost here, It's paralyzing in the dream like when it closes in on you, you can feel it coming at you from all sides and you can't talk or move but you can't see it you can only feel it.\nI have woke up from that dream terrified and almost hyperventilating more then once. \nI know they are odd dreams but I could really use any input you can give, serious input. Not the typical your a wacko answer alot of you want to give most people. thats a form of night terrors, sleep paralysis. I used ta have them and still do occassionally. After/sometimes not even after have a weird dream its like demons steal my vocal chords and im callin out but its jus like mumbling and whimpers and no1 else in the house can hear me, and then when I ACTUALLY do wake up I end up screamin lol. not really funny when its happenin tho. But ya, scientist and ur average joe will just say its somethin about transition between lightsleep to not quite reaching REM sleep. but as a Christian I know demons are real, so I believe they may also play a role. But everytime I have a crazy nightmare, whenever I call on the great name of Jesus I always wake up, or I fends off watevers around me.1	are skunk stripes always in the middle of their back?

It is also very predictible. The matches are so fake! I know it is 'sports entertainment' and scripted and that, but seriously, TNA is scripted, but they entertain me and they are unpredictible and the matches look real. TNA contains real talent. So does the WWE but the WWE puts its real talents in the locker room and get morons like John Cena out to hold and retain the championship for the next few years. Yes i agree with 'go TNA'. What also made me quit watching was the fact that the 'creative team' were really uncreative. They keep on reminding us the story lines that happened a few years ago. They keep on repeating things over and over again with a different twist; different wrestlers. It's crazy, it really is, they are running out of ideas and they are not entertaining me, have a nice day and thanks for this question.9	What does Presentence in when used in court?

In (10 * 10) paise, one of the 10's refers to the number of paise while the other is the number of groups of 10 paise available. Therefore when you convert to rupees, only one of the 10's should be converted.\n\n=> 1 rupee = 100 paise\n= 10 * 10paise\n=10 * 0.1 rupree\n=1 rupee8	How do I know if he likes me if I am a bisexual guy?

Like jerk. what kind of word is that? If someone said that to me I would just laugh. When I try and not cuss I cant think of any other words to replace those words. also when I try not to my mind wont let me. As in I'll be more pissed if I dont than when I do. The best way to do this is by in every day conversation, try and not use these words.  I would imagine, you have to also determine what it is that sets you off, to where you get to the situation, where you use these words as well.  It's not going to happen tommorow.. or the next day, but as you search for other words to substitute the bad ones... it will become easier1	WERE  I FIND CENTRAL FLORIDA  mINERAL & gAM  sOCIETY    WEB PAGE?

Dear Sista_girl06,\n\nYou're right that music influences us whether we like it or not. \n\nIt is indeed wise for Christians to stop listening to secular (non-Christian) music, or at least to be very careful to not listen to any secular music with questionable lyrics.\n\nIf you like particular styles of music, you can find Christian bands/ music from that style.\n\nE.g., check out the music at \n\nhttp://www.air1.com/\nhttp://klove.com/\n\nThe links are to the websites of two different Christian Radio stations, with different styles of Christian music. There are many other Christian radio stations and many many Christian bands with a variety of styles. The odds are that you should be able to find a Christian band or bands with music of the style you like.\n\nCordially,\nJohn6	hi i am required to submit a quotation for a certain job, it is some sort of a bid i guess. anybody familiar? may i know a format of a quotation and the contents, or maybe a sample will do.

The time spent getting rid of the damaged item (if it is large, like a furnace, you have to pay more shipping?)  Depending on the amount of damage, whether the item is usable, or parts can be taken off of it. \nAll that time you could have been doing something else that actually earns money for you...gone.9	Why is it gays don't want to be discriminated against, yet a lot of them discriminate against cannabis (pot) Why do they demand rights for their choices in life, yet many of them deny even the most basic human rights for people who chose cannabis (pot) over alcohol?..

I feel naturism is close to spirituality and orgasm gives a feeling of reflection of merging with God - feeling totally pure from within. BUT my family values and social/cultural background does not permit me to go ahead. Should I suppress all my feelings and ........keep on feeling BAD deep within ....... what should I do? Your guidance is solicited as being a delicate subject, I am unable to interact with my known circle. I am a highly educated female, close to 30 (unmarried) and looking forward for a practical solution by which self dignity is maintained and desires are also completely fulfilled. Thanks! Go ahead and try experiencing these things you crave.  There is nothing morally wrong about naturism, the enjoyment of our God-given bodies in the natural environment can indeed be a spiritual experinece.  If you don't try these experiences, you will always feel you are missing out and deprived.  You need to be brave and throw off your background inhibitions.  You can always stop if you find the experience doesn't match up to the expectation.  But, it is the things that we lack the courage to try that we regret, not trying things and deciding from a position of knowledge that we don't like them.\nI had a similar dilemma to you (still working on it actually) but where I have confronted it and accepted my desires and embraced them I am much happier.  You can contact me directly if you want to discuss it further.5	Who are the best basketball players in the world? Including Michael Jordan!!!!!!?  The best point guard to ever play the game would be Magic Johnson. He passed the ball like no one else could. And to be able to play all five positions, that is deadly. He is also the reason for the FAST BREAK. \n\nThe best shooting guard to ever play the game is Michael Jordan. He could score better than anyone guard who played the game. He is the reason Kobe plays the game. There are many and plenty that try to imitate him. Plus he is well known all over the world. I would even go as far as to say Elgin Baylor, but Elgin's competition during his time was not as quick or as strong as Michael's era. \n\nThe best small forward to play the game is Larry Bird. I would say Dr. J or Scottie Pippen or even George Gervin but because Larry could put his team on his back and go get it. . . .He could shoot the rock, post you up, dish the ball, drop a dime and he even had a couple of shake and bake moves in his game. That is what makes him the best.\n\nThe best power forward would be either Charles Barkeley or Karl Malone. Karl ran the floor better than Charles, plus he had an automatic 12-16 foot jump shot. But Charles could shoot from anywhere on the floor and dribble that ball up the court and put a move on you. They both could rebound the ball, well. So I think it is a tie with those two. It is just sad that neither one of them won a championship. \n\nThe best Center would have to be either Kareem or Hakeem (from the Rockets) Kareem has scored the most points in the NBA and had an unstoppable sky hook. He controlled the boards and blocked shots. Hakeem did the same thing, just he had a plethora of moves to make big men look bad down in the post. Just look at what he did to Shaq in the Finals, where he tourched Shaq for 28 pts per game. Plus he ran the floor just like Kareem. They both have championship rings, just Kareem has a couple of more. I think Kareem has a slight edge because of the most unstoppable shot ever. . . .DA' HOOK!\nGOD BLESS YOU and take care1	dear nerds everywhere, and ufo watchers.....? I know there are aliens that exist, because, well, space is endless, and you cannot tell me over the (estimated, but probably nowhere near close)99999999 planets in space, there is no aliens, but, do you believe we will see them ever, and if you give me some... classified info on *whispered* |205|W3||? I believe we'll find the remnants of an alien homeworld. Stars don't last long (not meaning Red dwarfs) so really, any advanced alien civilization would have moved away from their homeworld, unless they figured out a way to keep their sun from burning out :) In which case, I hope they'd share that knowledge if we ever met them ;D\n\nBut as you know, anything we see with telescopes is old, so chances are if we spot a world, the aliens there will either be gone (dead, or moved) or still there.3	What part of cotton is used for making the fibre?  Cotton fiber (once processed to remove seeds and traces of wax, protein, etc.) consists of nearly pure cellulose, a natural polymer. Cotton production is very efficient, in the sense that, ten percent or less of the weight is lost in subsequent processing to convert the raw cotton bolls into pure fiber. The cellulose is arranged in a way that gives cotton fibers a high degree of strength, durability, and absorbency. Each fibre is made up of twenty to thirty layers of cellulose coiled in a neat series of natural springs. When the cotton boll (seed case) is opened the fibres dry into flat, twisted, ribbon-like shapes and become kinked together and interlocked. This interlocked form is ideal for spinning into a fine yarn.2	Regarding blood glucose level: What does A1c stand for? I suspect that "A" stands for average; & the 1 & c?  Hemoglobin in the red blood cells comes in several forms. F is 'fetal' and isn't produced after birth. S is the sickle cell type, and so on. A is one of these, and 1c is a subtype of A. There are several names / abbreviations for it; it is also called glycosolated hemoglobin. It reacts with glucose to form a permanent combination. The modification of this form of hemoglobin has no particular affect on oxygen transport and so is without much effect, save as a record of glucose levels. \n\nFurthermore the reaction goes forward at a nearly constant rate, depending on the concentration of blood glucose. Since red blood cells last about 90-120 days in the blood before being recycled, the amount of HbA1c is proportional to the average blood glucose over the last 3 months or so (with some increased weight to the last few weeks in that period). \n\nThe usual value in a non-diabetic is around 5, and in diabetics with good sustained glucose control will be 6 or perhaps 6.5 or less. Values above perhaps 7 are evidence of sustained poor blood glucose control. \n\n\n\nAnother similar test is the "fructosamine" test. Like HabA1c, it measures the results of a relatively constant reaction rate with glucose, but in this case with blood protein (mostly albumin). It is reprocessed much faster than red blood cells; the value reflects average blood glucose over about 2 weeks.6	grants to start a business? are there any grants i can apply for to start a limousine service in horseheads,ny. this is my first business? It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html9	If the govermant raised taxes by 6% to pay for a universal health care program would you support it?

My question for you is, does she have a family doctor? and if so, she needs to explain what has happened. my mother is only 47 and she had a mild stroke(TIA)about two weeks ago, her family doctor had a MRI and a MRA done which showed some damage done to her brain...If your sisters doctor does not do something now then she could easily have another stroke that causes permanent damage..Keep calling the neurologist,be as persistant as you can be...If you have to take her to someone else and explain what's going on, normally when someone has a mild stroke it is a warning sign that a major stroke is  or will happen....

A friend of ours is bi-polar. He's a fantastic person, talented and creative and dedicated. When he takes his medication. \n\nAfter a month or two, he feels fine & stops taking it and totally loses the plot. Harmlessly, I mean; he stops coping & winds up in hospital.\n\nHe can't live alone, he can't hold down a job, and now his mom has Alzheimer's. She & his dad are not strong. I'm not family, none of us can understand why this goes on. He is never going to get any opportunity to get a direction in his life, not in two months, yet he has so much talent. It seems to us like medical care has completely failed him, and things can only get worse. \n\nIf you can get six-month contraceptive implants, why, why can't he get his meds that way? Right now he doesn't even have any options. Are doctors just too cautious? the manufacturers don't make it that way.  i think that your friend is in the minority in that most patients realize they need to be on the meds and the meds are what is keeping things on an even keel.  it's probably not profitable to the drug companies to make them as an implant...or maybe they just haven't considered it.7	brad pitt or johnny depp?

During a fall, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This is known as the cat 'righting reflex'. It always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so during a fall. Certain breeds that don't have a tail are a notable exception, since a cat moves its tail and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing.8	Is he trying to get my attention? theirs this guy i like and im not sure if he likes me back. at this party he was acting so nice and he was flirting with me by blowing bubbles at me and throwing some bubble juice on me. this was for fun but he started it. then he would sit by me inside and start talking to me. now at school when we switch classes (hes not in my class) im guessing hes trying to get me to notice him because hell always try to make me laugh and hell be like doing crazy dances around me and doing funny things, cause i do like a funny guy, (the things he will do are cute) when we past. and today we had a nice conversation in the lunch line. what do you think. does he like me or what? Yep, that sounds like flirting to me... usually when guys flirt with me, they get goofy and try to make me laugh. Or they tease a lot. That seems to be what this guy's doing. If the goofy stuff is directed to you, its flirting. I'm thinking he likes you... good luck, girl!8	What do you do when your sister-in-law keeps causing problems? My  sister-in-law was so nice to me at first and then just turned nasty, she has caused several family problems, I think my brother-in-law is a fantastic person, but he isn't allowed to visit us anymore and I feel bad for my husband who now seldom see's his brother. She can't seem to get along with anyone, even her own children and siblings. The problem is that her and my brother-in-law got married only after knowing each other 2 months and as soon as they were married she gained 50 lbs and turned into a different person, a nasty one. I have tried to pretend everything is ok and gone to visit with my husband, but she just sits and watches TV and won't even look at us. She is mean and rude and I feel sorry for my brother-in-law because I think he feels stuck in the relationship and won't say how he feels. \nDo we just keep ignoring the problem and let her go on hurting everyone around her?? I have had almost the same problem except it was my own brother. His wife was a bitch on wheels. Rude and unsociable to anyone. We tried to be nice, invited her on vacations you name it. We even tried to talk to my brother about the way she was but he didn't want to hear it, even though he knew we were right. After being married for 7 years he came to his senses and divorced her. Yeah! It was a great day. So my advice to you is, let him be for now. He will come to his senses; hopefully in less than 7 years. Its better to let him figure it out on his own then lose a brother over an argument about it.2	during pregnancy...?

Hughes is a good fighter but he got lucky with that arm bar against him, and he is wrestler and that's all. he is not a stand up person. GSP can knock him out. Hughes doesn't have knock out power. I think GSP will win in the second round.8	I'm a good person with good looks.7 girls I like.and 0they like me back.I have a GF but isnt workingout,help!

I wanted to know BUSH'S Iraq war is justified,Just for dethroning SADDAM,ruining whole Iraq bringing political unstability just in the name of Democracy.Do you people think present freed Iraq is better in any way from past Iraq.\nI just wanted to know what common western people think about it. The war in Iraq was clearly an illegal "war of aggression" justified by wholly manufactured and ludicrously mis-interpreted evidence.  The sole beneficiaries of this war have been oil conglomerates, military industrialists, and military service contractors at the expense of hard-earned American tax dollars and lives of American sons (and daughters) and thousands of Iraqi people.\n\nThis hoax of a war has also allowed the administration to put on the books policies that serve only corporate special interest groups at home and have not made us any safer in the least, unless you count the growing number of abolished freedoms as "protection against terror".\n\nThis strategy of pre-emptive war might actually fly if it was used for a solely moral purpose, but it is not.  The enemies targetted for this policy somehow all fall into the category of "resource rich".  North Korea deserved it a lot more.1	What are the effects of an Electric Shock recd.thro. contact with refregirator? CT scan and EEG are normal.

One would be a response to literature essay, where it is a case of reading a literary work, then describing the insight you obtained from it. Of course, you must prove it by the evidence in the text. Next is the summary, where you again read something and breifly state the main plot. You again need to specifically tell the reader the theme of this work. Another one would be fiction/ nonfiction. It tells an experience, fake or not, and enetertains a reader but also gives the insight and the purpose of it. There is also a persuasive essay, and then the research writing. Those types of writing are the most common in the literary world.3	do you think that harvard university is good for iranian student? if yes why? if no which university is good?  of course it is good!!

Racism typically refers to a system of oppression.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism\n\nUsually when an -ism is used, it is only meant to define the oppresor. For example, it is typical that sexism refers to men as the oppresor, since men have historically been the sexist, and women the victim of sexism. Of course we know, there are some seriously sexist women out there, and as women gain more and more power in society, sexist will refer more and more to women. This is because sexism, like racism, suggest that the person who is being described has power due to his sex or race and uses that power to oppress. Sexism typically means a man uses his sex to exert power over the other sex. Racism usually means a race of people use their race to exert power over other races. In this country, the race of people who has historically used their race as a source of power has been the white race. As blacks and other people gain more and more power, just like with women, you will see more of other races being called racist too. Meaning, people of other races are now using their race to have power over other races, including the white race. \n\nIn short, racism, sexism, and other -isms suggest that the perp is uses his race or sex or whatever as a source of POWER. One would be more accurate in calling blacks who can't use their race solely for gain, prejudice or race haters, which just basically means that they don't like or they hate people of another race but not that they use their race as a source of financial, political,academic, or social power in general.0	why are SOME people in the midwest and south so cynical/ignorant when it comes to other ethnicities? i mean, its 2006...nearly 2007 already...why is it that people from these areas,( and i know its not just these areas, but for the most part it is).....speak at such a psychotic level about torturing and killing immigrants and especially middle easter people? How is it that people in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, eetc.etc.......are so much more open minded and knowledgeable about these issue? If you have never lived in the Midwest, you have no idea. We tell it like it is. Hard work, play hard and stomp on anything we don't know about. Taught in school thata way.

What i know is angiograph is an imaging technique to visualize the blood vessels. It is not a therapeutic procedure, i.e. it cant cure you. May be your doctor mean angioplasty or other procedures with similar spelling.\n\nAnyway, i would suggest you to follow your doctor decision. He is the expert and he knows what need to be done.

So, there is a wide field out there.  Most CJ students look at jobs with the local PDs, Sheriffs, Highway Patrol, ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco & Fire Arms), ABC (Alcohold & Beverage Control), US Marshalls, Border Patrol, DOJ (Department of Justice), Homeland Security, FBI and CIA.  But there is also the correctional facilities, politics and law school to look at if you find those interesting.  These are ideas IF you want to stay in a CJ field.  These types of jobs will make you anywhere from $30 - 100k per year depending on your time of service and rank.  Plan on starting around at $35k  though...\n\nIn reality, only 30% of college grads find a career in their field of study - either through choice or because they couldn'g get the job they were looking for.  Once you graduate, the mere fact that you have a degree will open a lot of doors for you and you may find yourself being the manager of an accounting firm if you want!

Can I start over?\nWhat is a good field to enter?\nI have a logistics background but most of that was on the job training. If you are looking to start over and you have the financial flexibility, consider taking out a student loan and going back to school. That will give you some time to get on your feet, and it can be much easier to transition into a new field if you have some defined credentials.\n\nAlternatively, if you are willing to take risks and have a good idea, this might be a good time to start a new business.\n\nThere are lots of good fields to enter, anything from nursing to computer programming to molecular biology. Mostly, it depends on what you like to do and what you are good at.\n\nSpend some time thinking about what you wish you could spend your time doing. Is it working with people? Analyzing data? Working with your hands? Writing? Traveling? As long as it's not "sitting around watching TV" or something (and really, most of us would get bored pretty quickly with that), there should be a number of potential careers that allow you to do that.\n\nMost importantly, no career, no matter how lucrative, is the right career for you if you don't enjoy doing it.7	I want to write to Reese Witherspoon.

There was no country called Canada in 1840.  Canada became a country in 1867, and of course not all the provinces that are part of Canada today joined Confederation at that time.  Part of what is now Canada was considered the province of Canada, a colony of Britain in 1840.  So you would need to specify what you mean.  Do you mean the population of what constitutes Canada today?\n\nThe population of what was known as Upper Canada at that time was about 455,000 and the population of what was known as Lower Canada was about 697,000.\n\nI hope this helps.1	What is a graviton,and where does it come from,how does it interact chemically?

Chemically, it would not interact at all as it is far smaller than any atom, if it exists.3	How does stienbeck prepare you for the idea that the death of Curley's wife is inevitable?  Like the previous response, several instances of foreshadowing occur in Of Mice & Men.  Lenny's size, propensity toward petting/killing "soft things", etc. are repeated and made very obvious.  You could look at Curley's wife in  similar light.  She is not unlike a small animal, somewhat lost in the world and affected by many forces beyond her control.  She is also naive.  The story about the movie offer and her blind belief that her mother derailed her chances of living her dream life support this idea.  In addition, her physical "beauty" in contrast to the bleak scenery and lives of the many farmhands makes her almost otherworldly.  The innocence conveyed by her angelic features and naivete qualifies her as unique and somewhat ethereal (i.e.- too good for this world or life).  Some might dispute this, based on her behavior toward the farmhands, but you should consider her background and desperate efforts to gain any form of attention available to a woman in her position.  I think Steinbeck prepares you for her inevitable death (and the peace she finds in death - see the description of her lying in the barn) in both obvious and not-so-obvious ways.  It's all how you interpret what you're given.6	i want  to know american companies that hire labor from outside usa ? for example from egypt\nand wat r qualification?

Before I ask my questions I want to stress that I hope not to offend any existing JW's who will take the time to read this and help me better understand. (1)I would like the issue of not accepting blood transfusions explained to me since I just don't understand it and why if that was the ONLY option available left to save your child (for example) that you would be willing to let him/her die. (2) If someone who used to be a JW decides to leave the religion, and you see them on the street or in the grocery store, etc, etc, why are you not permitted to acknowledge them or speak with them? why do you go on as if they were dead? (3) If a former JW who left the religion dies, why do his/her JW family members not attend the funeral? (4) and why do JW's ring on people's doors so early in the mornings? I realize they don't always ring this early, but many times it really is annoying. Don't you think that only hurts in your attempt to potentially convert someone?

To be honest, I don't think any of them will. The posters so far have picked teams that haven't even qualified (Egypt, Cameroon). Most of the teams from Africa are first time qualifiers and don't have the skill or experience that more developed African nations have (eg. Cameroon, Nigeria). I think they will struggle to get out of the groups stages after the very tough draws.\n\nThe only team I can see managing even that is possibly Tunisia, and that's only if they spring a big surprise on Ukraine.2	Why does eating  asparagus make your urine smell funny?  "As you clearly know, the human digestive processes are typically able to break asparagus down into smelly by-products with an amazing quickness, often within 15 to 30 minutes after eating. When you use the lavatory, those odorific by-products are released as a rather pungent form of "asparagus urine." \n\nThe website WebMD blames this smell on the break-up of a chemical called mercaptan. That said, asparagus contains a half-dozen sulfur-based chemicals identical ones found in other such lovely smells as rotten eggs, garlic breath and skunk spray. There is some controversy in the scientific community over exactly which by-product, or combination of by-products, causes the asparagus urine smell. The first published study on the phenomenon, written in 1891 by a man going by the name of "Nencki," found that the smell was caused by a metabolite called methanethiol. So far, this conclusion seems about as sound as any.\n\nBut the story of asparagus urine is far from ending there. Some people eat asparagus, go to the restroom, and-amazingly-no smell. Further research suggested that, likely due to genetics, some people did not possess the enzymes required to create asparagus urine. Perhaps you've heard it said that a person who's pee smells after eating asparagus has high intelligence? Well, maybe there is some genetic corollary for that. (Just kidding, all you eugenicists out there!) \n\nTo complicate matters even further, however, around 1980 a scientist had the good sense to pass the urine of the non-asparagus urine population in front of the noses of the asparagus urine population, and lo-and-behold, many found they could smell that asparagus urine smell. People are now debating whether genetics controls the ability to produce asparagus urine, the ability to smell asparagus urine, or possibly both."\n\n http://www.greenworks.tv/askgreenworks/asparagus.htm9	the main reason immigrants come to the US is because the people are so great. true or false?

Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body, wed cardo, thurs lower body, fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)5	Will Messi live up to his new title " the new Maradona"?

No. It's a myth.\n\nThis is another myth/hoax/urban legend. The American Cancer Society has this to say about 'sodium lauroy' (Sodium Laureth Sulfate):\n\n"Shampoo \n \nRumor:\n\nOne chain email floating through cyberspace says a common ingredient in many health and beauty aids is known to cause cancer. The warning reads: “Check the ingredients listed on your shampoo bottle, and see if they have this substance by the name of Sodium Laureth Sulfate, or simply SLS. This substance is found in most shampoos, and the manufacturers use it because it produces a lot of foam and it is cheap. BUT the fact is that SLS is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very strong. It is also proven that it can cause cancer in the long run. I went home and checked my shampoo (Vidal Sasoon), it doesn't contain it; however, others such as Vo5, Palmolive, Paul Mitchell, the new Hemp shampoo, etc. contains this substance." \n\nFact:\n\nSodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and its chemical cousin sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are known irritants, not known carcinogens. SLS and SLES are powerful surfactants (wetting agents) and detergents. They have industrial uses because they are detergents that exert emulsifying action, thereby removing oil and soil. There is no way of knowing where this Internet information comes from, but there are a variety of Web sites offering health and beauty products that are SLS-free. According to David Emery and his Urban Legends website, "All these Web sites are maintained by 'independent distributors' for various multi-level marketing companies hawking natural personal care products. As a matter of fact, the majority of URLs returned in a standard Web search on the keywords 'sodium laureth sulfate' all point to versions of the same propaganda." \n\nhttp://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_6_1x_Shampoo.asp?sitearea=MED5	Who would win in a real life street fight?

In New ZEaland be appropret Although sailors from the hastily-despatched HMS Britomart proclaimed British sovereignty over the South Island at Akaroa in 1840, the area was settled that same year by French settlers who had intended to establish a colony.

They are full of the technique of passing and passing and passing until a foward or an offensive player shoots. This is a place where midfielders are lauded since they make clever passes to fowards and must know when to or to whom to pass.\n\nany opinions? I would rather mix it like the French, long passes like Sagnol can do when it's called for or the passing, passing, passing when you have the midfielders to carry the ball to the strikers like Zidane could do. As we saw at the WC, the Italians couldn't really do the passing style technique because the French defense was so great and most of the time stole the ball there.\n\nEdit: Good question by the way.9	should a person get personal on here? either with hate or contempt?? i owe everyone on yahoo answers an apology, i wrote some hateful things about banana bean 01 , i let her get too me with  her remarks,i was wrong  and i just want to say i am sorry...i am not that kind of person and i think i should just let you know!!!

Instead of Yoda fighting Sidious, and Obi Wan fighting Anakin.....if they reversed, and Obi Wan went to fight Sidious and Yoda battled Anakin..... Clearly, Sidious takes out Obi Wan (he's good...but not ready for the emperor was he). Anakin, certainly is no match for Yoda either and I think he would be to twisted for even Yoda to bring him back by now. \n\nSidious must now take on a new apprentice, but he still succeeds in creating the Empire, although weaker without the power of Vader to help him. Obi Wan isn't able to deliver Luke or watch over him, or influence him to join the rebellion. Yoda still has him transported to "his family" and after Owen and Veru are slain he joins the Academy to become a gifted pilot in the rebellion. \n\nHan is never employed by Ben to fly to Alderan, and Leia is executed by General Tarken as planned, prior to the rescue. \n\nR2D2's plans never make it to the rebellion and they are ultimately destroyed. Luke is captured by the Emperor once he realizes someone that strong in the force exists. Luke, without the influence of Ben and Yoda, is easily converted and trained in the Dark Side from scratch (probably killing off the interim apprentice). \n\nThe Sith rule for 1000 years.0	Just clear up the air if there ever was any confusion any religion = delusion?

Should I retire? I am a liberal Democrat from the great state of Massachusetts. I have a small drinking problem and my hobbies do include drinking and walking around my backyard in my underwear watching my nephews bring over girls to rape. My brothers killed Marilyn Monroe and the whole family has BIG issues with our teeth, flying in airplanes and guns. I enjoy midnight rides after drinking a fifth of bourbon with a beautiful lady at my side as I drive over rivers using bridges. I am so drunk right now and confused. Do you think I should retire from public office? Help me please. And I do think Hillary is HOT. Hell, that's nothing! I'm a conservative Repubican from the great state of Texas. I used to get really drunk while I was in college, but my Dad always managed to "take care of it". Even when I was into drugs, he kept it all covered up so that I could continue my path toward public service. Then I joined the Reserves, but only because I thought it would be cool to fly a jet plane. So my Dad arranged that, and then saw to it that I could get out of any real 'military service' since I was too busy bilking investors out of millions of dollars. My brothers might not have killed a movie star, but one of them caused the infamous Silverado Savings & Loan scandal; my other brother helped me steal an election (or two) with fraudulent voting 'chads' and irregularities in how those votes were tabulated. Then my Dad's influence with Supreme Court justices helped me go on to become the best damn president this country ever's seen! I enjoy hanging out with my capitalist buddies and planning how to illegally invade sovereign nations just so we can grab all the oil underneath their sands and make me, my buddy Big Dick, and all our cowboy friends richer and richer and richer.\nWhat the heck, we've killed tens of thousands of Iraqi women and children, and more than 2,500 American soldiers, but like my buddy Donnie Rumsfeld once said at a news conference, "Stuff Happens." \nI've single-handedly put this country trillions of dollars in debt, while playing "Robin Hood in Reverse" (that's where we take from the poor and give it all to the rich). \nWith the help of a pliable, cowardly, corrupt U.S. Congress, I've dismantled the U.S. Constitution, destroyed all environmental-impact laws and regulations that were designed to keep our fragile ecology in place, and turned this country into a police state where citizens are considered guilty until proven innocent in a rigged court of law.\nSmall countries all over the Earth are now terrified of the U.S., and are considering their own nuclear weapons programs just to defend themselves against the globe's newest "evil empire' - the United States of America!\nI condonded all of my friend Donnie Rumsfeld's unspeakable terror, torture tactics, abuse and murder until the damn press got wind of it all. Then I put on my best actors' face and told gullible Americans that I think it was unconscionable. Ya' gotta love Ronald Reagan for writin' the Republican manual on great acting!\nI watch out for my wealthy elitist friends, lobbyists, special interest groups and huge corporations that can all make generous (if not illegal) contributions to help keep the GOP in power. Meanwhile, we like to neglect the needs of the poor, the aged, the homeless, the disabled, the underprivileged, and the unemmployed. Why should those scumbags think they have a right to live in America anyway?\nI've pretty much accomplished everything my Dad and Big Dick told me to do, all without much accountability or remorse. But, then I've lived the life of a spoiled rich kid who never had to take any responsibility for his actions. I just wish I could find an intern in the White House with whom I could have oral sex (of course, she'd have to proclaim to be a born-again Christian).\nI'm not sure whether I should retire from public office of wait until I'm impeached or tried for high treason and crimes against humanity. \nBig Dick and Donnie say there's a special oil-soaked corner of Hell that Satan's reserved just for us where we can spend our eternal damnation blaming each other for what a mess we made of the world. \nAnd, maybe, if you're as confused and drunk as you are right now, we can have a drink and talk about our differences. Just make sure I'm within earshot of Big Dick so he can tell me exactly what to say. Ain't politics great?

Why does no one attempt to question the origin of their faith? People are susceptible because people are afraid.

When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught.

I'm moving 57 miles away to a new apartment. I want to know what would be the best way to inform my magazine subscriptions to be sent to my new address. I read that the USPS will only forward them for up to 60 days. How do I get them sent to me after the 60 days? Hi I worked in the forwarding department and my best advice is for you to contact the magazine. We would send a form 3579 change of address to the periodical publishers & many times they took forever to change your address if at all. We forward the magazine for 60 days, hoping you will notify the sender. Then after that we notify the sender of your new address for up to 60 days. If you notify your publisher you did not recieve an issue due to a move they will more than likely send you out another. Good luck with your new move!\nPS Their address is listed in the first 5 pages, the editorial section, or the last 5 pages of the magazine. For the USPS it always starts with "Postmaster send address change to", but if you find another addresses sometimes listed for customers, use that instead.. . .I think ours come in bulk to them & get put in their "to do" pile.8	can some1 help me out here?

The name "Jehovah" is an English translation of the Hebrew name pronounced as or similar to "Yahweh" or "Yehowah"; the exact original pronunciation is unknown. The four Hebrew characters corresponding to the letters "YHWH" are well-recognized as the biblical personal name of Almighty God, and are universally designated as "the Tetragrammaton" or "the Tetragram".\n\nFor centuries, most Jews have superstitiously refrained from pronouncing aloud any form of the divine Name. They base that superstition on the third of the Ten Commandments given to Moses:\n(Exodus 20:7) You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/bible/ex/chapter_020.htm?bk=Ex;chp=20;vs=7;citation#bk7\n\nOver the centuries, that Jewish superstition has expanded to also forbid writing or engraving any form of "YHWH", even when simply copying from one of the nearly 7000 occurences in the Hebrew Scriptures. In recent centuries, some superstitious Jews have even forbade unabbreviated EUPHEMISMS for "YHWH"; capitalized terms such as "Tetragrammaton" and (amazingly) even "the Name" are forbidden by such superstitions.\n\nMore recently, the Jewish superstition has ballooned out of all reasonableness by also forbidding respectful impersonal TERMS referring to the Almighty; thus many Jews insist upon writing "G-d" or "G~d" rather than "God". They may even refrain from capitalizing impersonal terms such as "Creator" and "Almighty".\n\nNaturally, the religious and superstitious practices of a person are between him and his Creator. However, in recent decades these superstitious Jews have worked to impose their superstitious sensibilities beyond their religious communities, and onto the entire populace. Thus, although "YHWH' is unanimously recognized as the personal name of God, few today use any form of it in their writings and conversation.\n\nInterestingly, Christendom has largely joined with superstitious Jews in suppressing the use of "Yahweh" and "Jehovah". However, it seems that Christiandom's anti-YHWH bias largely devolves from their hatred of Jehovah's Witnesses, the religion almost single-handedly responsible for the growing public recognition that the Almighty God of Judaism and Christianity actually does a personal name.\n\nIt seems that too many are more interested in coddling superstition than in allowing intellectual honesty and respect for the Almighty.\n\n(Psalms 83:18) That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth\n\n(John 17:26) [Jesus said] I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/na/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20040122/7	What was the first Outkast album?

Thanks!0	Was Jesus really a vegetarian? not your opinion.? If you think he wasnt state your facts from original sources! Fish is not considered meat according to Jewish laws, but primarily the biblical support of the notion is in that, aside from fish, there are no specific accounts of Jesus eating meat.\n\nThe old testament suggest that seeds and fruits are men's appropriate diet -Genesis. The prophet Daniel and his companions were vegetarians according to the old testament, and were healthier that way than eating as the king did, based on an informal test mentioned that was conducted by their Babylonian care takers, to make sure they, as advisers to the king, were taking good care of themselves. Ezekiel also mentions food appropriate for vegetarians in the now famous - Ezekiel 4:9.\n\nGenerally speaking, religions which end up widely successful in their efforts to encourage humbleness regard vegetarianism preferable for that purpose, though usually do not require it. The accounts of Jesus in the Gospel support this notion. By suggesting those justified before God are the sinners that can't even lift his face to pray from shame, but still praying humbly, correlates with the saying "The weak man only eats herbs, but the strong man eats anything." Jesus never spoke without Spiritual importance reflected in it.\n\nVegetarianism is encouraged to aid in developing a refined approach to life of the spirit, and is recommended for the humility involved,. St. Paul spoke of nothing being unlawful in truth, but if eating meat offended his fellow men and women, that he'd remain vegetarian for their sake.\n\nThe vegetarian diet is also easier on the land, taking only 1/30 the amount of land for the same amount of nutrition as meat production, since most of the energy from the food goes to the animals rather than the humans intended.2	teeth whitening after getting braces off.....? I just got my braces off a couple of weeks ago, and i want to get my teeth whitened. \n1) do i need to wait a certain number of weeks before i whiten them?\n2)What is the best, cheap, but effective teeth whitening system? Crest? I am familiar with these questions as I too have had the same 'dilemma'.  Here is what I was told by my dentist and representatives from several (I shopped around) tooth whitening companies:\n\n1) A residual glue that you cannot see nor can dentists/orthodontists remove by simple polishing of the teeth after the braces are removed can remain on the surface of the teeth for up to four weeks after the braces are removed.  If whitening is attempted before all of the glue comes off naturally, the potential for 'spots' or streaking on the teeth from uneven whitening increases.  Therefore, I would suggest a minimum of three to four weeks before I would use any type of strong whitening outside of toothpaste.\n\n2) Despite all of the RELATIVELY expensive tooth whitening toothpastes on the market, you can use a simple home remedy of baking soda on your toothbrush after regular brushing.  This works as good, if not better than a toothpaste, and is cheaper.  It does not taste great though.  The problem with the 'painted on' whiteners is that they do not last very long, and over the long haul, they will cost A LOT to maintain.  The alternatives to bright white from Target or Wal-mart are effective, but do not last nearly as long as those that you can buy from your dentist (Brite White and Zoom).  While these are significantly more expensive than store brands, they will last one to two years without outside maintenance, and they are more effective.  You could also do an in-office whitening which speeds up the whitening process (1 afternoon vs. 2 to 3 weeks with Bright White), and costs roughly the same.\n\nToothpastes merely remove surface stains like coffee/smoke/food from chronic build-up over the years, and only work to 'whiten' them close to back to where they were before, but Zoom or BriteWhite will whiten them well beyond what you can get from a toothpaste or naturally.3	What sort of after school activities do 10 year olds do these days (serious answers only)?

So what if Jesus had a wife and children. Would that be so bad?\n\nFACT: In the jewish faith of that time, it was frowned upon to NOT be married and have children. (Yes, this IS historically correct.)\n\nFACT: The Bible is so full of holes, mistranslations, books missing, one king's perverted thinking towards women, ... I don't need to go on. The bible is CRAP compared to it's original writtings and even then it wasn't written for decades after Jesus' death.\n\nFACT: People think this whole "Davinci Code" thing is all new. It's actually been around for quite some time now. Brown wasn't the first and won't be the last. First the author of the Davinci Code did not study the bible or theology.  He wrote it as a work of fiction.  Second why your first fact is true, it does not mean that Jesus had a wife.  If the bible would say that he had a wife Christan's would not have a problem with it.  You can't add on to Jesus story just because you think this or think that.  Third where is your prove that the bible is full of holes.  Did you study the dead sea scrolls in it original language, or are you just going on what you heard.  Lastly I wonder if the bible is such "crap" why are you fighting so hard to discredit it?  I have no problem with you being a non believer, but why do you attack Christianity?4	do you hate or love ebaum's world.com?

The word set was to tell all the players on the field to get set (get in place) because the play (the snapping of the ball) was soon to happen.  However, the history of "hut" is more obsecure.  It is know that for many years prior to the adoption of the word "hut" into the use of army drill sargents by saying "hut, 2, 3, 4" so it is possible it was incorporated into football because it was easier to hear than a number while maintaining discipline among the players on the field.  I hope this helps.5	How Many People think that Ecuador will make it to the second round during FIFA 2006? Its just a Simpre question. I think they have a real chance.

What would happen if they fired them all to avoid the fines? Think about it. If all of the employers decided to fire all illegal aliens there would be millions of people on the streets. If they keep working them they will run the risk of being fined. Sounds like catch 22. What's your take on this? they shouldn't hire them first of all. and if they fired them all then nothing would happen! what part of ILLEGAL doesn't America understand. pot is illegal, murder is illegal, under-aged drinking is illegal and so on and so on. first off the employer should pay his/hers employees what there worth. and not take short cuts. i could go on and on about this question. that hummer he/she drives is because of my labor, and the labor of many others. but if your not from AMERICA and you come to this country of ours do it the legal way, like my forefathers did. i live in the second lowest paid county in the U.S. the reason they hire them is for cheaper labor. did you know that 100 us dollars is something like 1,000 in Mexico? no wounder there here. if they earn 10,000 dollars there almost a millionaire in Mexico. you or anyone can e-mail on this subject look at my 360 page. screw it. m.anania@yahoo.com6	gear pattern for fuller or roadranger 13 speed?  standard transmition, low range is 1,2,3. intermediate is 4,5,6,7,8. high range is 9,10,11,12,13. 1,4,9 over to you and down. reverse is over to you and up.2,5,10 beside reverse. 3,6,11 beside 1,4,9 and so on....1	How do i work out the critical angle of something? if i have something like glass (n=1.50) to air? n = sin i / sin r.\n\nwhen i = 90 degree r is called critical angle. \n\nsin 90 = 1\n\nTherefore, n = 1/ sin r\n\nsin r = 1/n =1/1.5= 0.6666.\n\n r = sin inverse of 0.6666 = 41 degree 48 minute 37 second.2	what is continuous mechianical ventilation/respiratory?  i love you7	4 categories of ethnic instruments? please answer it Please give some more info.

Somehow, as rare as I think it is, I would find myself battling between sexes. I don't know why, but there is this power, strenght, and easy going life that men SOMETIMES follow, while women have this suffering,painful,fragile, yet loving life SOMETIMES. The women are argumentative, mentally strong, physically active just as the men are, and they are much more fragile with their hearts, and their soul is much more heavier. They suffer while giving birth to another beautiful human life, and they live complications with their periods, until menopause hits their stage of life.Yet they are intelligent creautures who know what they want,dream,desire,and are extremely passionate about. A mans heart, can carry so much, they can be physically hurt and mentally hurt, but yet, hard to define which of them both will affect them more... They are just so in charge of situations, much more at risk than women, and somehow they have challenges to meet, but never fail to obtain what they so majestically propose to themselves! I know women have been challenging and successfull throughout their lives too, but there are those little painful things that make me want to change into the opposite sex... Men are strong too, but yet, there is this darkness in them that make me want to have second thoughts about changing from my own opposite sex....I don't know which change I would pick..but I do know this...GOD created us a certain way, and that is how we have to live accepting for the rest of our lives...it is no mistake, since he KNOWS where our paths lead! with this said, go through the path that has never been touched...AND leave a trail!5	Are you looking for a good website to play pool on , check this out!?

She signed the agreement already.  What happens if she backs out? There are a number of volunteers who never finish their assignment; more than half cannot handle the pressure.  So it is quite common.\n\nUntil your friend actually goes to the Staging Location (DC most of the time), she will have the option of easily backing out.  Some people never show up for staging, and some show up but then change their mind or don't pass medical exam.  \n\nOnce over there, it is still possible to quit, and we had about 5 who quit during training out of a group of 67.  She will not be in a massive amount of debt, but if she quits after finishing training she will have to return a certain sum of money -- like relocation allowance, living allowance, things that she should not have spent if she quits early.  \n\nI hope that she will not back out, as the experience is very rewarding.  I greatly enjoyed my time overseas and would like to have extended it, but the bureaucracy only approved a limited number to do so.  \n\nWhat country will she be going to?  What assignment -- teaching, environmental, health?  \n\nLet me know if you and she have any more questions.5	What is cricket called in hindi? What is the term used for cricket in hindi?

My soon to be ex has a blog page and all the details of his dating life, love life, and current exploits are very public.  He details the trips he takes on the weekends, vacation plans, etc.  As I have the kids 100% of the time, if I had a blog page it would involve trips to school, dinner time, bath time, bed time, and work.\n\nHow do you feel about your ex or soon to be ex dating and declaring his/her love for someone else?  And knowing him/her is vacationing, taking trips on the weekend, while you are making sure homework is done, kids are growing into responsible adults, pets are fed, and you still have a job on Monday morning? That's really harsh on his part; you'd think he would at least be discreet about it since you aren't divorced, yet.\n\nI am in your shoes, with one difference...my soon-to-be ex is telling everyone that I am sleeping with "every guy in town" and chasing off any potential relationship I may have (but don't have time for) while he is secretly dating multiple women.  And, right now I have 100% custody of our children, am receiving no child support, and he cant even see the kids due to a restraining order.\n\nOne part of me is upset (and a little jealous) that he is living the life of a bachelor, while I have all the responsibility - especially because HE is the one who destroyed our marriage (domestic violence)..........\n\nHowever - and I hope you feel this way too - a much larger part of me feels such pride that I am doing it all on my own; that I get the bath times with my children, and I get to read them books everyday; that I am corresponding with their teachers and helping with homework; that I get to be the one to kiss their boo-boos, and celebrate their milestones (like my littlest learning how to ride a bike without training wheels!), pack their lunches, and sing and dance around the house with them...\n\nAnd I have a full-time job with a lot of responsibility.\n\nI know what he's missing out on, and truth be told, I feel sorry for him.\n\nGood luck to you!

Control-Alt-Delete (often abbreviated to Ctrl-Alt-Del) is a computer keyboard command on IBM PC compatible systems that can be used to reboot the computer.This keyboard combination was designed by David Bradley, a designer of the original IBM PC. Bradley originally designed Control-Alt-Escape to trigger a soft reboot, but he found it was too easy to bump the left side of the keyboard and reboot the computer accidentally. He switched the key combination to Control-Alt-Delete, a combination impossible to press with just one hand (this is not true of later keyboards, such as the 102-key PC/AT keyboard or the Maltron keyboard). More advanced operating systems use its status as a "reserved" combination for various purposes, but often retain the ability to trigger a soft reboot in certain configurations or circumstances. David Bradley is also known for his good-natured jab at Bill Gates, at that time the CEO of Microsoft, and also the creator of many of Microsoft's programs: "I may have invented Control-Alt-Delete, but Bill [Gates] made it famous", alluding to the perceived instability of Microsoft operating systems.0	why do you believe in God?  I was born into a world of God's love.  Before I was old enough to understand what it was, I was learning about God in Sunday school.

Affordable Housing is sometimes referred to by gov't when they are approving a building project.

While regular rent could be $2000 per month, the units set aside for low income might be half that.\n\nThere would be a criteria which would vary from city to city or state to state as to what 'low income' is.  There is not a Federal standard.2	How do I find out if a doctor in Texas has been sued for malpractice before?

Karl Malone had already made over $100 million in his career, and the only other thing he wanted was a championship. It almost worked.\n\nThe amazing thing about his injury is that, in his 19 year career, he only missed 9 games, and I think 2 or 3 of those were because of suspensions, not injuries.  \n\nHe picked the wrong time to get hurt, but even though the Lakers tried to assemble "the greatest team ever" that year, the Pistons were at the top of their game by the time the finals arrived, and they deserved to win it all.\n\nThat year, the Lakers were seemingly able to come back from any defecit (they in fact overcame a huge defecit in game 2 of the finals), and this caused them to sometimes become complacent, which you can NOT afford to to against a team as defensively strong as the Pistons. (This was the year that the Lakers came from way down to beat the Spurs in one of the playoff games, when Derek Fisher threw in that off balance jumper with less than a second left to win the game).\n\nBut to literally answer your question, I wouldn't say Malone got 'burned' by leaving the Jazz, as the Jazz weren't going to win it all anyway... the Lakers appeared to be his best shot. Acquiring Gary Payton and Malone, to join Kobe and Shaq, the Lakers did in fact have 4 Hall of Famers on the floor... and Malone was not interested in his personal stats (had he stayed in Utah, he might have become the NBA's all time leading scorer, rather than remaining 2nd behind Kareem Abdul Jabbar). He just wanted a ring.\n\nBut even though the Lakers had a good record that year (56-26, they started the season at 18-3, then lost 2 in a row, they were 20-5 at one point) they were still a bit inconsistent, as Gary Payton never fully adjusted to playing the triangle offense.\n\nKarl Malone might have been the hardest working player in the history of the NBA, not to mention being the 2nd most durable after Wilt Chamberlain. I'm sure if he had to do it again, he would make the same decision.2	What can be done to counteract "brain fog ".?  fresh air if not sleep and exercise6	Does this sound like a cool idea?

This rock is a rusty yellow on the outside and white crystalline on the inside.  I am just assuming it is quartz.  I chipped off a little corner of it and checked on search engines to see if I could find a match, and the closest I could find was quartz.  Is it rare? Is it valuable? 27 pounds! Wow! 27 pounds is a very large size for a quartz crystal.  I would imagine if it really were quartz that it may be quite valuable.  Since quartz consists mainly of silica (SiO2), an unpolished stone may appear white on the inside.  In fact, sandstone is also composed of silica and since you mention that your stone is rusty yellow, without actually seeing it, I might suggest that it is a variety of sandstone.  There is also a chance that it may be citrine.  Please check out the links below.  There is a photo of rutilated quartz in the third link that sounds similar to what you describe.  If your stone is quartz, it would be great to try to sell it.  Good luck!1	I wonder - which is quicker, heat or cold ?

Contrast this with a continuous number system, in which, for any two numbers that are not equal, you can find infinitely many numbers that lie between them in value.\n\nFor example,  the integers are a discrete number system, whereas the reals are a continuous number system.\n\nComputer math is inherently discrete, although it can in many cases form a useful approximation to a continuous system.\n\nThe series that you mention have been developed for continuous number systems, but I believe they have analogues for discrete systems.5	Which of the following wrestlers do you think used steroids?

And I don't think it's d because a great circle is finite and returns to its original starting point. Statement a is true.  B is not true, as distinct great circles (which are the lines of spherical geometry) intersect at two points which are antipodes of one another.  C is not true for the reason you observed, as is D.  Thus A is the only statement that can be true.  Of course, we have to understand what a segment is in spherical geometry.  In Euclidean geometry, a line segment is that portion of a line which falls between two points (this is an informal definition, by the way.)  What is true about line segments in Euclidean geometry is that they are paths of minimum distance between their endpoints.  In other words, every other path between two points is longer than the line segment between them.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, lets talk about segments in spherical geometry.  They will be portions of lines (great circles) between two points.  Notice that, given any two points on a sphere, there is at least one great circle that passes through them (if these points are antipodes, there are infinitely many!)  Here's one difference between Euclidean and spherical geometry:  on a sphere, there are two line segments between these points.  Draw a circle and put two points at random on the circle:  you'll see both segments right in front of you.  One of these will be of shorter length that the other (unless you picked antipodal points, in which case the line segments will be of equal length.)  \n\nSo, what does this have to say about shortest distance?  Great circles are what as known as geodesics, which are constructed as paths which minimize distances between points on a space.  Straight lines are the geodesics of Euclidean space.  This isn't trivial to show.  So A is somewhat true, in that it is true that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere is given by a line segment (portion of a great circle.)  It is not true in that any line segment is the shortest distance between those points.1	How many kilometers is 1 meter?  One kilometer is 1,000 meters.

I believe our country is so divided that it will once again be another close race. Republicans are disenfranchised with the Bush administration and Democrats are trying to cater to the conservative voter because of it's powerful force. The smarter of the two political candidates should tout themselves as a moderate rather than a conservative or liberal. Politically, I believe a moderate will win the White House in 2008. Realistically, I belive a Democrat will win the White House in 2008, UNFORTUNATELY.8	is my relationship wit bola ever gonna work out fine? we go through difficult times together....but i love him it depends on how both of you together tackle situations before you. anyone of you want to runaway or hide from the consequences, then the problem of breaking up of relationship sprouts.7	I want to know what the song is called, "if i just lie here would you lie with me.."? whats that song? i cant think of it all.

First of all, know the serieses allotted to different service providers such as BSNL, Air Tel etc. They have specific numbers. with this half of the number can be remembered easily. and for balance say the number rythemically or whether the number can be fitted in even or odd series. and finally remember the total of the number. For example 9826883422 can be remembered like 9+8+2+6+8+8+3+4+2+2=52 5+2=7. Like this.5	american foootball in the UK? does anyone know of a football team for 16 year olds in the north west, of england. me and my friends got into it about 3years ago, but cant find any were to play. why does it have to be an organized team? just grab a pigskin and head out to the corner lot. start throwing the ball around, and running plays. other kids will be curious and want to join in. i played thousands of neighborhood pick-up football games growing up and always had a ball. 6 or 7 people per team is all you need. a quarterback, a couple of receivers, and a couple of lineman to block. you draw plays in the dirt, and instead of having to go 10 yards, you play 2 completed passes equals a first down, those are typical neighborhood rules here in the states. but both passes must be completed beyond the line of scrimage. you get 4 downs, just like in the NFL, but there are no field goals, oviously. punting is optional on 4th down, again, just like the NFL. this can be done after school, or on saturday afternoon, all you need is a ball, a grassy field(size of the field may vary), and 10-14 players. this is so much easier and fun than joining an organized team and going to practice, buying equipment, ect.4	what is the unit of the speed of super computers??

Lust is when you 'love' him because you have to - because your hormones are making you do it - and only after that start finding excuses to do loving things.\n\nLust is when you want to take without giving at least as much in return.\n\nLust is when you calculate how much you're going to give by how much you're getting.\n\nLust is when you marry him because he's giving you what you want, and you just 'have to have it'.\n\nLust is when you move on because you're not getting what you want from the relationship (even though there are good reasons, having nothing to do with feelings, that a permanent relationship between you would make sense).\n\nLust is when you move on just because someone else is giving you what you want, while the one you're with isn't (and there's no other, better reason).\n\nLust is when you can't live without him, and are just devastated when he breaks up with you or says difficult things to you.\n\n***************************************\n\nLove is when you have made all those little choices to 'love your neighbor as yourself', and all of a sudden after a while you find you've got a huge soft spot for him in your heart, and you suddenly notice he's handsome, and then...\n\nLove is when you wait until you're ready for a permanent relationship before doing anything that will bind you together permanently.\n\nLove is when you give for the joy of giving. Period.\n\nLove is when you marry because you believe that there's something you will be able to do together, and maybe already are doing it, and you'll be able to do it better if you marry.\n\nLove is when he's rejected your marriage proposal, you sometimes don't even dare dream of 'being with him' anymore - and you don't feel the need to 'make yourself move on'. You are happy with your life.\n\nLove is when, when you're with him, you're so happy to be with the one you love that you forget the hard things he's said to you.\n\nIn other words, love is when he's in your heart, but you don't 'have to have him' - but neither do you 'have to move on'. You love him because you choose to.0	How was life different when you were a child? Socially, technologically... the norms of everyday life. What were the differences then?\n\nThis question is open to all age groups. When I was a child, we did not have VCRs.  If we missed a movie in the theater or wanted to see it again later, we had to wait for it to come on TV.  Often, when it did, it was edited to fit a time slot.  I remember waiting once a year to see "The Wizard of Oz."  At Easter we waited for "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben Hur."\n\nWe didn't have video cameras, so if you wanted to record moments like piano recitals and swim lessons, you had to have a movie camera.  I was the only one I knew in my age group who had one.  My grandpa had one and would do these elaborately staged family gatherings to catch us all on film.  He had to set up bright lights, and we all looked artificial and like deer in headlights.\n\nWe didn't have video games.  The first one I remember was "Pong."  My cousin had the Atari game system.  We spent hours watching those little white lines move across a grey screen.  Hard to believe now.\n\nWe didn't have cell phones and computers.  I was a little bit of a hold out, but I didn't get my first computer until I was in graduate school.  I couldn't face typing my thesis over and over on my typewriter.  I had a dot matrix printer, which used paper that was perforated and had to be pulled apart.  Our phone was a plain black, rotary dial phone.  We had one.  I got a blue phone of my own when I was in high school.  \n\nI loved records and would buy 45's of the top hits often.  I also bought albums of Barbara Streisand, Jim Croce, and Broadway musicals.  I listened to them all so often that I hardly had an album that wouldn't hiss or skip.\n\nWe hardly ever ate out when I was growing up but we did get "fast food" from time to time. We'd have MacDonald's on Friday night while my parents went out and we watched "The Brady Bunch."  Sometimes we'd have Kentucky Fried Chicken (it wasn't called KFC) on Sundays after church.\n\nWe go out quite often compared to when I was growing up.  Sometimes with the price of groceries it even works out cheaper to go out.  I don't remember it ever being that way when I was a kid.\n\nWe had one family car when I was growing up.  There weren't any seatbelt laws, and we would all pile into that car.  When I was pretty small that was a VW Bug, and one of us always had to lie down in the little space behind the back seat.  It sat over the engine and was hot.  I remember that we went camping and put a mattress in the back seat and we all rode piled on top of it.\n\nWe didn't have to wear helmets when we went bike riding or roller skating, which we did every day in the summer.  We would stay outside playing in the neighborhood until the street lights came on, and my parents never worried that someone would snatch us or that we wouldn't come home that night.\n\nWe would walk to the movie theater by ourselves and stay all day since they would show the double feature over and over again and you could watch as many times as you like.  No one worried then about when the movie started.  You just showed up whenever, and if you missed the beginning, then you stayed to watch the movie over again.  "Star Wars" is the first movie I remember that showed only that one movie and you were told to arrive at the beginning and had to leave after that one showing.  It cost $3.50, which was a lot of money for one movie and one showing, but some of my friends saw it 14 times.\n\nWe were in church every time the doors were open, which were for us, Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night and various other rehearsals and events.  Now most people I know who go to church go on Sunday morning and then maybe to a small group during the week and an occasional event here and there.  There are many people I know today who have never been to church.5	how much is glasgow rangers football club worth?  about half of what paul telfers' left leg is worth....1	What is the name for the six months of night in the South Pole? I was thinking something along the lines of 'equinox' or 'solstice', but I can't remember. :( That period is called the "polar night", nothing more fancy than that.\n\n\n\nThe winter solstice is the day, all over the world, that the days are the shortest.  In the northern hemisphere this is on 21 or 22 December, in the southern hemisphere it's on 21 or 22 June.\n\nThe summer solstice is the day when the days are the longest (on 21 or 22 June in the northern hemisphere and 21 or 22 December in the southern).\n\nSo, on the solstices the length of the day and the altitude of the sun (at noon) are the maximum or the minimum compared to all the other days of the year.\n\nAn equinox is when the sun passes over the equator, which happens twice every year, around March 21 and September 23.  On those two days the night and the day have equal length on every location in the world.6	What does Incorporated (INC.) mean in USA law ? if i have website 'Myweb.com' Can i use 'Myweb Inc.' in my website (I am not American) Foreign companies can't be incorporated in the United States???

This is really an interest free loan that you make to the bank.\nThe taxing authority determines whether you must pay all at once or in installments. Usually, there is a discount for paying all at once, which of course is the pro to paying all at once.\nHowever, if your taxes are really high, then paying them quarterly might be better, since you could hold onto more of your money and invest it. You would have to perform a cost/benefit analysis, but generally this would be possible on really expensive real estate with high property taxes.7	Where can I trade and swap my porn videos online?

I don't think that the Earth is as small compared to the sun as a golf ball compared to the Earth itself. \n\nI would say a Red Supergiant, one like Antares, the alpha star in Scorpius, would be much like the Earth when the Earth is compared to a golf ball.\n\nNew!:\nI just received the information from Wikipedia.com and I did some calculations. \nthe diameter of a golf ball is about 0.00004 km, \nthe diameter of our Earth is about 12756 km,\nand the diamter of Antares is about 924000000 km. \n\nSince calculating the volume requires us to cube the radius (let us ignore the pi and 4/3 for simplicity's sake since in ratio, they don't matter). So:\nthe cube of the radius of the golf ball is 8 x 10^(-15) km cubed,\nthe cube of the radius of our Earth is 2.6 x 10^(11) km cubed,\nand the cube of the radius of Antares is 9.9 x 10^(25) km cubed. \n\nWe can get a brief idea of their sizes by comparing the powers of 10: \n\ngolf ball -> Earth is\n1 -> 100000000000000000000000000\nEarth -> Antares is\n1 -> 100000000000000\n\nSo Earth is far bigger than a golf ball than Antares is than Earth (at least from my calculations). \n\nNow, returning to the questions, I would say something 1000000000000 times the size of Antares, probably a nebula.0	Where's the phone-its ringing?

Comments like "They're taking our jobs" or "They don't pay taxes" are repeated often. But, are they true?\nDo illegal immigrants really hurt our country, or are they just a convenient scapegoat in an election year? i think there is a wave of xenophobia sweeping through right now and that is causing alot of it.  as for facts that back up the quotes...many of them are not compiled correctly, or promoted heavily from skinhead and other racist sources, but passed around until they aren't really connected with those sources anymore.  and much like any "facts" from those areas are very very distorted, or even just made up.\n\ni also find it interesting that many of the people that are attacking the illegal immigrants would also probably not hesitate to say they would do anything at all for their families...and many illegals have said this was a driving force behind their decision to cross the border.\n\nas for the groups that say they should do it legally or what not...laws change, thats just the way it is and thank god we live in a country where the laws are flexible, despite how slow and red tape filled this process can be sometimes.  so yeah during this time of the law changing some people are going to get it easier than those previous to the change, but there always seems to be people resistant to this.\nlook at the equal rights movements, the start of unions, women's rights to vote, etc etc...there was an alarming number of people that heavily tried to resist these movements as well....and sadly some still do.\n\nas for hurting this country, i don't really see it, illegal immigrants are not going to make or break any of the programs that are starting to buckle right now, but do make a convenient scapegoat i think as something people can point to and blame.  on the other hand, they do spend a good bit, and many local businesses depend on the money they spend(which they are charged sales tax on) so these companies would really get hit hard if they lost those customers.  apartment landlords would also really take a hit it seems, and despite the fact we have homeless people, there isn't really a shortage of housing available.3	Any institute offerin BPT for 10+ 2 , commerce?

He and his doctors have tried every-f***ing thing out there. It doesn't go away.\n\nAll you can do is control it.\n\nKnow what triggers an attack, and avoid it.\n\nWith my brother, it's animals.  He has no pets, and doesn't spend much time at my house...I go visit him.\n\nFor me, it's tree pollen (but not flowers), cigarette smoke, and pollution/smog.  I stay indoors as much as I can during pollen season or high smog days, and call in sick if I have to. It doesn't win me any points at work, but the alternative is only managing a half-day of substandard work before I end up in the emergency room.  As to the cigarette smoke, I avoid bars and nightclubs.  Just because I don't deal well with the smoke does not give me the right to dictate other people's choices.\n\nMy other brother's asthma is triggered by flowers and perfumes.  He avoids gardens, and leaves for work earlier or later than the regular rush hours because some people feel the need to dump an entire bottle of perfume on in the mornings. You can't open the windows on the subway trains, so again, he can choose a non-standard commute time, or go to the hospital.  He's also stopped going to church because of the incense and old ladies overdoing it with perfume.\n\nIn your case, you should probably ask your doctor to do an allergy test as well.  Anything you are allergic to will also trigger an asthma attack.  Most people will not have to go to such extremes as my family does, but "forewarned is forearmed."  Knowing what causes an attack will help you control the disease.1	What is the largest cat?

Unfortunately you didn't provide enough information to get a clear answer as much depends on your citizenship and your plans. However, even if you are an American citizen he will not be able to enter the United States without a visa, husband or not.  Visa free entry to the US is only for American citizens or citizens of the 39 countries in the Visa Waiver Program (Argentina lost this status in 2002).  Of course, if he is Argentine, he is probably also eligible for citizenship in Spain or Italy (through his ancestry), which passport he could use to come and go freely, for stays up to 90 days.\n\nIf you get married abroad, you will have to file an I-130 petition to get him an immigrant visa in order to enter the United States.  If you reside in Argentina, you can do this in BA.  Buenosaires.USEmbassy.gov. \n\nIf you are truly resident there, meaning usually for more than six months, you can go into American citizen services and file your I-130 petition.  In about six months your husband will have an interview and a physical.  If all is okay, he will get his immigrant visa and then one he arrives in the US, he will be able to get his green card.\n\nAlternately, you could choose to file an I-129 for a fiancee visa, which will have him apply at the Embassy in about a year for a fiancee visa (K-1) to come to the United States for the wedding.  After the wedding, which has to take place within 90 days, he will start the process for his green card.\n\nA third option if you are living in Argentina and have no plans to live in the US is for him to get a tourist visa, which he can use if he can show ties to his country of residence.  A tourist visa is not available to intending immigrants, however, and should not be used to enter the US to get married (a consular officer knowing this fact would refuse anyway) nor to reside.  However, if you can show that you are a bonafide expat, and that he has ties there, it shouldn't be a problem to get a tourist visa.\n\nSo you see, if I knew your situation better I could advise you better, as it really varies.  Good luck.5	Sandy Koufax pitched for what major league team?  Sandy Koufax pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1955-57, then on the Los Angelese Dodgers (The Brooklyn team relocated) until 1966.

It is stated that this shots are only good for three years, after which there is no hard proof that there is still protection against said decease.1	the binomial distribution? Hi there,\n\nTwo men play 15 games of darts. The probability that one of the men win one game of darts is 0.3. What is the probability that that person wins less than half the games?\nWould it not be the probability that he wins less than or equal to seven games, since we cant play half a game? Yes, that would be the probability that he wins 7 or fewer games\n\n15!/(0!15!)(0.3^0)(0.7^15) + 15!/(1!14!)(0.3^1)(0.7^14) + ... + 15!/(7!8!)(0.3^7)(0.7^8)\n\nYou would have to compute 8 probabilities and add them together.\n\nI get it to be about 0.95.5	How much does it cost to build a firepit? My friends and I are in college and are moving into a house next fall, and we are planning on building a firepit out of flagstone and cement it about a ft' into the ground in the backyard.  It's probably going to be about 3' tall, and about 5'+ across.  Does anyuone know how much all that would cost and any building advice for that project? It all depends on where you get your material. Remember to call and have all your under ground pipes and wires marked. To get a round shape I used a piece of PVC, it was probably 3' diameter, that I got from a farmer that used it to supply water to his fields. I just dug the hole a bit bigger than the PVC and filled with concrete in between the ground and the PVC. I Then Put a brick they sell at Wal-Mart around the top edge before it dried. It looks like its all brick. I stacked them about 3 bricks high and used the concrete as a mortar. Then about a week later when it was all dry I mixed up some more concrete and put some in the bottom (removed the PVC first) and let it set. About a week later we used it. And we used it a lot. We also had expanded metal Cut to the size of the pit so it can double as a grill. Just remember to have handles welded on if you do this. This is so when you need to add wood you can remove the metal with gloves. Smores + fire pit + beer = a good time. I bet you could get something similar to the PVC I used, like maybe culvert. You could also just do it with all brick. I hope this helps. Good luck. And remember to get it how you want it the first time. I ended up digging up the one I described to build a bigger one. And the second time around it was pricey. To buy all new materials it could vary in price depending on how you choose to do it.1	When the concentration of molecules on both sides of a membrane is the same, the molecules will? a. move across the membrane to the outside of the cell. \nb. stop moving across the membrane. \nc. move across the membrane in both directions. \nd. move across the membrane to the inside of the cell. c.

Back in 1945 at the Nuremberg trials, leading Nazis and war crimes perps were hanged - no argument - no lengthy appeal process - no mass demonstrations and appealing to the powers that be to pardon them. \nNow, this has all changed. \nIf someone has really done something that they are without rehabilitation - mass murder, sexual assault and then murder of children or eldery, serial killing - should society pay for keeping them living in a cell for the remainder of their life or should that person be - (for the want of a better word) - disposed of? \nIt is obvious that the death penalty is not a deterrant - look at the murder rate in LA - but should a sufficiently adult and developed country flinch from executing these criminals? You're right, the death penalty is not a deterrant.  It is a purely moral issue and an understandable one.  It's not wrong to think people who do horrible things shouldn't get to live out their days, even if it is in prison and I doubt many death penalty abolitionists would be protesting to save Hitler from execution.  However, the problem is in the application.  Some people who do the most horrible things don't get the death penalty, and some who do things that don't rise to the level of horrible do.\n\nI say leave it up to the victim's family.  If the criminal is eligible for the death penalty, let the family decide and let them pull the switch because they are the ones that will have to live with the pain the rest of their lives.\n\nAlso, it is just as expensive to society for someone who is sentenced to death because the State pays for the appeals process, which is automatic and lasts for many years.9	What is "Dutch courage" ?

Or do they also take non military person who have specific skill such as computer, hands to hands combat, fire arms, knowledge of political science, etc...? You will not find any 'mercenary' group that will take 'computer' and 'political science' skills as pertinent to the occupation. That's left to the person or persons bankrolling the operations. To say you have 'hand to hand combat'  or 'firearm' experience, you MUST have to have been a soldier. No such thing as a non soldier with hand to hand combat experience. Any one can gain firearm experience as a civilian, but when comparing a small arms aficionado to a professional soldier who has years of experience around firearms, the civilian is gonna lose the pick.\n You can always join some rag tag militia in a third world country who will take anyone who is willing to pick up an AK-47 and get paid with heroin and call yourselves 'mercenaries', and that's if they allow you to live if you are Western.\n The ONLY possibility I can give you, is if you have expert medical schooling.  Basic medical knowlege might not do because most soldiers receive that during their years in service. If you are a doctor or surgeon, the chances are good you can go ANYWHERE in the world.\n  You also have the possibility of become a police officer trainer in foreign countries, much like we have in Iraq training their police. But, of course, you need to get that certification here in the states before applying for those positions. There are a few companies hiring police for this, most of the contracting companies in Iraq need them, so it's not hard to find. Halliburton, General Dynamics, PAECIVPOL...these are some who need officers to train foreign police. Hope this works for you.4	i need a antispywhere and pop up blocker that dosent coast me anything?

Medieval Italy \nAround the year 1000, we have the first documented recipe for pasta in the book "De arte Coquinaria per vermicelli e macaroni siciliani", (The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli) written by Martino Corno, chef to the powerful Patriarch of Aquileia. \n\nThe first historical sources referring to the production of dried pasta in what seems like a small-scale industrial enterprise date from 1150 when the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi reports that at Trabia, about 30 km. from Palermo, "they produce an abundance of pasta in the shape of strings ("tria" in Arabic) which are exported everywhere, in Calabria and in many Muslim and Christian countries, even by ship." \n\nIn 1279 a Genoese soldier listed in the inventory of his estate a basket of dried pasta ('una bariscella plena de macaronis'). A document from 1244 and another from 1316 testify to the production of dried pasta in Liguria, indicating that pasta was now common all over the Italian peninsula. \n\nBetween 1400 and 1500, the production by craftsmen of "fidei" (pasta in the local dialect) became quite widespread in Liguria, as demonstrated by the founding of the Corporation of Pasta-Makers in 1546 (the oldest surviving document of this guild, however, dates from 1571) in Naples. In 1574 a similar guild was founded in Genoa, three years later, the "Regolazione dell'Arte dei Maestri Fidelari" (Rules for the Pasta-Masters' Art Corporation) were drawn up in Savona. \n\nIn 1584, the author Giordano Bruno quotes a Neapolitan saying, " è cascato il maccarone dentro il formaggio " (the maccherone has fallen into the cheese).0	what does????? what does violet mean in relationships It means a color or a flower.5	Is there any rules of holding your tennis racket? I have a habit of back swinging in a different style...is there any rules that I can't play like that? There are no "rules" for how you hold the racquet.  The physics of the game of tennis will determine the best way to hold it for a particular shot.  As for the backswing, again that doesn't really matter as long as your stroke starts down and goes from low to high.  Without the low to high motion you will not get sufficient lift on the ball to have it carry over the net.  The backswing is just a way to get the racquet to the postistion to start your forward motion to the ball.0	if we had world peace and no one hated each other? would it get boring I would like to find out.8	What do you think if I m just an ordinary girl standing in front of a boy asking to him  love her?

Three friends contributed $10 each to buy an item that they liked with the thought that the item costs $30. So they called a boy and handed him the $30 and sent him on an errand. The boy went and bought the item which, incidentally, costs $25 only. Thinking that if he returned all the change, the three would have difficulty dividing it  among themselves equally. So, he took $2 and returned the rest. Hence, the three thought that the item costs only $27. If they paid a total of $27 and the boy got $2, and if the original amount handed over to the boy was $30, where is the missing Dollar now? it's all how you look at it, think backwards. if they gave him 30 - 2 the boy took, there's 28. subtract the 3 the boy returned to them and there is your 25. the problem was originally about a hotel and a bellhop5	Why did the Lakers trade Shaq?

I have two children, they both have light hair and blue eyes and both me and the father have dark hair brown eyes. His parents have dark hair and so do mine, his father has hazle eyes. The only people i have are my uncle who has blue eyes and my grandmother on my dads side who has blonde and blue. The father queastions this constently. I have been loyal but am also curious, I have heard that recessive genes can appaer out nowhere is this the case? Most likely yes. Also remember blonde hair does get darker eventually. Mine's turning dirty blonde (from blonde). My dad's hair is black and my mother's is brown. I THOUGHT I got blonde hair because my grandfather had it, however, my dad's hair used to be blonde and it turned to black. Also I am the only one besides my grandfather to have hazel eyes.... I am the only blonde female. I think they can occur out of nowhere. Because you can't know everyone you are related to nor can you meet them. Some families go many generations back. Like I am Cherokee, but I am 100% white and blonde. So I believe someone along the way might have had light hair and blue eyes... and if these are infants blue eyes change sometimes and so does the light hair. Don't worry so much.

Can someone jus tell me the Reasons & Evidence of singporeans being rude... No matter u r singporeans or jus a tourist... Well, I believe in every country there will always be rude and discourteous people. On the flip side, there will also be polite and well-mannered people. Let's not compare why certain people are nicer than others. Let's face it, the human race ain't perfect at all. And each and everyone of us has our own set of perceptions and thinking with regards to other peoples. \n\nAnd remember, the survey is just a figure which can always change with time. \n\nBut on personal account, perhaps the reason why Singaporeans emerged 30th probably stems from the individualistic personality and due to lack of social cohesion. The 'culture' that puts one before the society perhaps may cause the lack of graciousness among some members of the society. It all boils down to the individual's family upbringing and environment, to a large extent. Hence, there are differing factors that might lead to the lack of courteousy among some Singaporeans.8	What are signs of a girl who is talking with me on the phone likes me? i talk to her on the phone a lot, what are some signs i can tell that she likes me Does she get excited/happy when you call her?

I work there,so I know ! It is quite possible that not everyone is as diligent in their work as you are. Also very possible that the workers in question think they are helping by doing what they do. Alot of the people in question had children who were American citzens, though their parents are not. Because the children themselves are eligible citizens, they can get welfare or food stamps to feed them. In fact, through an article in the L.A times, the county supervisor said that about 100,000 children of illegal immigrants in the county collect $276 million in annual welfare benefits. He also stated that 98,703 children of 57,458 undocumented parents received Cal-WORKS welfare checks in January, or a total of 156,161 recipients. Most of this was because the children were citizens. Though I am not familiar with Cal-Works or what benefit it entails, studies have found that due to 1996 restrictions, it is harder for illegals as well as natives to get welfare. But, the proportion of illegals who get food stamps and medacaid is significantly higher than that of the native population. In fact, it was found post 1996 reform that the percent of illegals who naturalized jumped significantly, all among those who had once received aid. It was also found that one in three families headed by an illegal immigrant is using one type of welfare or another. And because they are not usually educated people and are often low skill workers, the ones that do contribute taxes contribute much less than other families. For this reason, if we legalized them tax payments would increase 77%, but the net deficit would rise to 117%, because they would be legal to receive all the services that they are currently having difficulty accessing now.3	Levers, pulleys, and wedges are simple machines.

Starch doesn't taste sweet because stach IS NOT a sugar. (Take notes Mashira).\n\nStarch is composed of lots of sugar molecules strung together, but because they are strung together out tongues don't detect them as being sweet.\n\nBoiling a potato loosens the starch up and makes it digestible, but it doesn't change the primary chemical structure. It starts out as starch and it is still starch after boiling. Boiling doesn't convert it into sugar.\n\nAs Dan says, you need to expose the starch to digestive enzymes to convert it to sugar.8	Are you a romantic?

My step daughter is taking forensic science and needs help with this question. Of those choices the most obvious answer would be D. Arson.  A Spectrograph is used for chemical analysis.

What accelerant or catalyst was used in the  starting/spreading of the burned area.

Mankind was made in the image of God.\n1) God is Spirit, but He made mankind flesh and blood by creating something out of nothing.\n2) The physical man has an end, but the soul of man is immortal meaning it will never die.\n3) Man has the gift of thinking, of which animals do not. Man also has a free-will to choose right or wrong. Animals do not. Animals have instinct, mankind has reason.\n4) Man did not have to use his conscience until after the fall in the Garden of Eden. After they sinned against God, their consciences were used to guide them.\n5) Man is limited to the laws of the physical universe while he is still alive in the flesh. Once a man dies he will live in the realm of the spiritual and will have no limitations like he does now.\n6) Man has freedom to make choices but he cannot change his chief end. The chief end of all mankind is to praise and glorify Jesus Christ for all eternity.2	What is the craziest dream you've ever had? Mine was a recurring dream when I was a kid. I was in my Elementary school gym. There were those short little orange cones on each corner. There was a giant pink bunny (no kidding!) chasing me around the perimeter of the gym. In front of me was a guy that looked like Indiana Jones, with a whip and everything! We just kept running around the gym. The bunny never caught me and it wasn't scary, it was just weird! Crazy, right? I had a dream I saw Jesus in Jerusalem when I was a very little girl.  I lived in the mid-west, but in the dream we were in Jerusalem.  I thought I saw something, so I left my mother and went into an alley.  The alley was really dark, and every so often there were people who were playing out Jesus's life.  When I got to the end, he was there.  He held out his hand, and I woke up.\nI only had this dream once, but boy do I remember it!9	New Party!?

Ordinarily, I would say the guy is too immature for a relationship and not to waste any more time on him.  He sounds like a nice guy but it seems to me you are not who he really wants to be with.  If you REALLY want to continue going after him, it sounds like you need to back off a bit.  Are there other boys you are friendly with?  If so, try paying more attention to one of them, and less attention to the one you like.  Probably a good idea if this boy sees you paying more attention to someone else also.  Give it some time.  He may rethink his feelings for you.  And if you still don't get a reaction out of him, say, in about a week or so, then approach him and ask him why he hasn't been hanging paying attention to you much.  This is a bit manipulative, but if there is anything there at all, hopefully this may bring it out.

Another question asked by a teacher who doesn't know the subject she is trying to teach. \n\nAll plants can hold water in their stem. Even rainforest plants commonly store water in their stems.\n\nSome of the most spectacular water holding plants are the tea trees of Tropical Australia.  These trees mostly grow seasonal wetlands in areas that are literally flooded for part of the year and receive little rain  for the rest of the year. The trees are capable of holding several hundred litres of water  in bulging hollows in their trunks. What makes this so spectacular is that water exists as free water. It simply sits in a hollow in the wood, and if the wood is cut the water gushes out.  Aboriginal people obtained water during the dry months by cutting holes in the stems to drain the water.\n\nCacti, boabs and a range of other plants can also store large amounts of water in their stems, but none store it as large masses of free water as the tea trees do. Instead the water is held in the cells or the  vessel elements\n\n\n>>>>How does it help the plant?\n\nIt allows the plant to survive through periods when water is scarce. Most plants only store enough water to last for a few days while desert plants or plants from seasonally dry environments like the tea trees can store sufficient water to see them through weeks or months.5	who's your fave a1 racer?

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

Brasilia\n\nBrasília is located in a Federal District, created from the state of Goiás in the Mid-West region of the country. The District is bordered by the Preto River in the east and by the Descoberto River to the west. Brasília is situated on a 1000 m high plateau called the Planalto Central. The city is located at 15°45' South, 47°57' West (-15.75, -47.95). Brasilia is 207 km from Goiânia; 1,531 km. from Salvador; 716 km. from Belo Horizonte; and 1,015 km. from São Paulo.8	Girls!!!  when a guy is interested in you and looking at you, what's the diff between interested and 'creepy?'

There are MANY types of headaches...with several different origins. The most common one is the tension headache, which originates in muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder areas. Others include things like migraines, cluster headaches, and they are also a common feature in many other illnesses like the flu or other generalized infections. They may come from muscular sources, vascular sources (in the blood vessels of the head or brain), or--RARELY--from increased pressure inside the head from something like a brain tumor or fluid mechanics problem.  Most headaches are simply a nuisance, though some can truly be debilitating, and NOT related to any serious pathology.9	how long does it take to get approval for a US citizen's wife to have a green card?

Another abnormal thing is India winning nothing in every olympics. This is because India lacks sports culture in general, sports is just not given enough importance. Also add the fact that the whole nation is totally in love with cricket which is faboulously marketed. The Indian FA is just not rich enough for the betterment of the game. One thing i might mention India did get an invitation in 1950 WC in Brazil. But at that time FIFA had introduced the new rule that all players must wear boots. Indian players were not used to it & FA could not afford it also as India had just got her independence in 1947 & was economically unstable.

I was planning to host my own web server on my computer. But then I had this incident where I was downloading <insert favorite anime here> from the torrent network. And I turned my PC on for 4 days straight I think.... And then on the last day, it was at 90% of the whole downloading process when suddenly my computer hanged. When I restarted my PC... I cannot boot anymore. So I reformatted it and then it started out cleanly. But then... All of what I have downloaded(8.57GB!!!) was erased!!!! So, I was traughmatized of that incident so I asked this question. Now back to the question, up to how many days can the Hard Disk be turned on before shutting it off to make it rest? How long is a piece of string?  A hard drive can function indefinitely sans manufacturing defects or extreme heat.  I have 2 primary hard drives and 2 external drives running on my machine 24/7, only rebooting when a necessary update is required and things are fine.\n\nA hard drive is the only mechanical part of a computer and as such will at some point fail.  BUT when that is can not be predicted.  I would say 90% of the time it would work faultlessly until you are ready to change your machine0	Biblelovers, how do you feel about the Revised Standard Version? I kind of like it, but KJV is still my favorite. I like the New Revised Standard Version quite well.  When I learned some Hebrew, I soon was able to see that the NRSV was the truest to the original language and meaning.  It is not perfect, but I found it to be the most honest in conveying the original text.\n\nI have further been convinced of this because when I began to major in religious studies in college, all of my professors always recommend the NRSV because of its accuracy.  Therefore, it wasn't just me!  It apparently really is good.\n\nI also like the New Jewish Publication Society's version. \n\nThe KJV has a magnificent poetic quality that really cannot be easily replaced.  It just sounds pleasing to the ear!  And it is often the text we have memorized as children, and so nothing else sounds right sometimes.  Psalm 23 for example, just has to be KJV if you want that poetic, beautiful style.\n\nHowever, if you want a better view into what the original may have sounded like, you may be better off with NRSV.  There is no "Thou" in Hebrew.  There is just "ata."  It didn't sound flowery to the people who used it.  It sounded more like "you" sounds to us.  It is not so formal.\nThis is not to say that the original Biblical languages have no poetic value.  On the contrary, they DO, and as always it is difficult to translate poetic quality into another language.  The Hebrew loves plays on words.  You usually have to read the footnotes to catch these when you are reading a translation.5	What does this mean? Cleveland at Houston, Week 17 -- Why did a dog like Browns at Texans make the list? Because with both teams sitting 2-6 at midseason, and 1-7 Arizona having already drafted its quarterback of the future this year in Matt Leinart, this game might just turn into the Brady Quinn Bowl (a.k.a. the battle for the No. 2 overall selection). Sure, the Cardinals could trade the No. 1 spot to somebody who covets Quinn, and the Texans could opt to pass on a quarterback once again with David Carr already on hand. But you get our drift, so just go with it.\n\n\nSo if Brady Quinn is the 2nd overall pick, who is the first? I see Quinn getting drafted early, I believe a trade up into the top 5 for a team is possible that wants Quinn.  Number one pick who knows there really isnt a clear cut top 5 draft order yet4	if someone stole my computer is there a way to track it? using the internet or some other source.?

Ignorance and insecurity.  \n\nUnfortunately, many people in society are uncomfortable around anyone that's different from them.  So whether it's a different race, religion, style of clothing, or differently-abled, most "normal" people reinforce their sense of belonging and "superiority" by putting down those who are different.\n\nMany people also have little to no exposure to those with severe hearing loss, and therefore don't understand the culture, or that most deaf people have normal intelligence.  And be aware that when someone speaks a different language, the communication barrier is intimidating and often frustrating.  \n\nBut please don't think that ALL people are like that.  Especially in a one-on-one interaction, you'll find that most hearing people are kind and even curious enough to want to learn more about you and what your life is like.  But teasing most often occurs when people are in a group (and especially during the teenage years, when "fitting in" is perceived as a high priority).  \n\nBe proud of who you are and prove the ignorant people wrong by living your best life with dignity.  Good luck!1	With linear equations, how can one tell if these following problems are consistent, inconsistent, or dependant the first is 3x+y=5 and x=2y-3 (consistent), then y=-x+4 and y=-x+2(inconsistent), then y=-x+4 and 2x+2y=8 (dependent).  I mean how can someone really tell these are what they are?  I kinda now see that the second one has -x+ 2 and -x +4 but dang, someone help put at least two of these into regular english:(( First, put each pair of equations into "slope-intercept" form, which means that each equation is expressed as y = mx + b, where m and b are constants.\n\nPerforming this step for the three pairs of equations produces the following results:\n\n3x+y=5 and x=2y-3 \nbecomes y = -3x + 5 and y = (1/2)x + 3/2\n\ny=-x+4 and y=-x+2 is already in slope-intercept form\n\ny=-x+4 and 2x+2y=8\nbecomes y = -x + 4 and y = -x + 4\n\nNow you're ready to analyze them:\n1. if the two equations are identical, then they are "dependent." That is, for any value of x the two equations will produce the same value for y. The FULL name of this situation is "consistent, dependent." In other words, the two equations have at least one solution (i.e., they are "consistent"). And in fact they have an infinite number of solutions because they are identical (i.e., they are "dependent").\n\n2. If the two equations have the same value for m (the slope), but different values for b (the y-intercept), then they are inconsistent. That is, there are no combinations of x and y values that satisfy both equations. In graphical terms, they consist of two straight lines that do not intersect (if they intersected, that point of intersection would be a solution of the two equations). This is true because the two lines are parallel. We know that they are parallel because they have the same slope. We know that they do not meet because they have different y-intercepts (i.e., they are parallel lines that pass through the y axis at two different points).\n\nFinally, if the two equations have different slopes (different values of m), then they are consistent, independent equations. That is, they are consistent, in that there is at least one solution. And they are independent because they are not simply identical equations. How do we know this? Because the slopes are different, the two lines can not be parallel, so they must intersect. And being straight lines, they will intersect in exactly one point.\n\nThat covers all the possibilities:\n1. the lines have different slopes (different values of m), so they are not parallel (consistent, independent)\n2. the lines have the same slope (same value of m) and the same y-intercept (same value of b), so they are the same equation, and their lines exactly overlap (consistent dependent)\n3. the lines have the same slope (same value of m), but different y-intercept (different values of b), so they are parallel and non-intersecting (inconsistent)0	What is retirement? It is not what it was 50 years ago and some would say that there is no such thing in reality.

It helps if you understand people and work well with  them. You need to be knowledgeable of the business in which you're leading. You need skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, delegation, planning, coaching, communication, time management, discipline. You need character strength, because leadership is one of the hardest things you'll have to do.

There are 2 ways to achieve that:\n1. Use percent values instead of fixed units(px, pt etc). \nGood point: This way your website will always be proportioned the same way in any resolution.\nBad point: You may experience inappropriate display, if the resolution is too big, or to small.\n\n2. Make different sets of templates for each resolution from 800x600, to 1600x1200, put a JS on your index page, that will detect users resolution, and serve the right template.\n\nGood Point: Your webpage will look as desired.\nBad Point: Some users keep their JS browser options disabled, therefore you won't be able to detect and serve the right template. It also implies a lot more work, than option no. 11	Explain what is happening when you come in contact with extreme cold that damages you skin, re: hypothermia.?  Hypothermia is a dangerous drop in your body's core temperature. FROSTBITE is when your skin/tissue is damaged by cold. Basically, the water in your tissue freezes. Ice crystals damage/destroy tissue cells, and the cells die. If you get serious enough frostbite the skin turns black - meaning the tissue is dead. Which is why fingers and toes need to be amputated... to prevent the spread of gangrene.2	Is their anyone out there that had their wisdom teeth pulled ?out because i need mine out soon?  I have.

Busch is supposed to be the stepping stone into a Cup car, but if Cup drivers steal the spotlight, how can sponsors or owners make a qualified decision as to who they want to recruit or sponsor? I think they should have a limited number of spots for Cup drivers in Busch series.   A lot more Cup drivers are using Busch series to practice on because of the limited practice sessions. Also, it draws more people to a Busch race when there are popular Cup drivers there.  \n However, I don't think Cup drivers should be allowed to have the points when they are not full time drivers in Busch series.  There are a lot of Busch drivers that are losing spots in the standings due to the Cup drivers coming in and finishing better.  Look at the standings now in Busch series, the top 7 spots are held by Cup drivers.   The Busch drivers need to make a living too, the Cup drivers are double dipping and to me that's not fair. \n\nAnd lastly, I don't think you should be allowed to race for 2 championships.  Look at Harvick, he's currently 7th in cup and 1st in Busch series.5	Whats happened  to Woodworm? I was shoping for a cricket bat on Staurday 13th 2006.

Des poulets et les canards sont infectés. Peupler les manipulent et sont exposés à la grippe d'oiseau.2	can a dental infection cause vertigo , blurred vision and balance problems?  It certainly can, but there would normally be other problems as well.   Vertigo and ballance problems can be caused by infections near the vestibular section of the vestibulococlear nerve (cranial nerve 8), that passes through the internal acoustic meatus, which is connected to the teeth because the teeth get sensory innervation from branches of the facial nerve, which also passes through the internal acoustic meatus.  Blurred vision would be a little harder to explain, I'd bet the optic nerve is not being impinged upon, but perhaps the infection is causing pressure inside the orbit and blurring the vision.  I hope you are at the very least on an antibiotic.  This isn't really all that likely to have happened, and it would be a little easier to believe if you also had ringing ears and painful, puffy eyes.  Perhaps the dental infection and the other symptoms are unrelated, but either way they need to be treated.2	Do meal replacement shakes really help you to loose weight?

To achieve this aim, the BNP advocates the use of "firm but voluntary incentives" to remove ethnic minorities from the UK. Membership of the party is restricted to "Indigenous Caucasians". A British National Party European election candidate in the Eastern region had close links in the 1980s with a convicted criminal and two notorious paedophiles. \nSid Chaney, an elderly former Londoner and Islington National Front officer who now lives in Essex, is sixth on the BNP's list for Eastern England and a council election candidate in Basildon. In the 1980s his circle of friends included Desmond Fenwick, who was involved in a number of police investigations into horrific murders of gay men, and George Wilson, who had a liking for very young boys. \nChaney was around when a gang of teenage armed robbers, who were politically involved with both the NF and the extreme nazi British Movement, were frequent visitors to Wilson's flat, which doubled as the local NF headquarters. \nPaedophilia is one of the most dreadful crimes against children. The BNP has made paedophilia a major plank of its 2004 election campaign and has tried to barge in on local campaigns on the issue. Now Searchlight reveals the BNP's own dirty secrets as a service to voters to warn them of the type of people who are campaigning for their votes. \nSearchlight published the full story of Chaney and his disgusting circle of friends and fellow fascists in Islington in September 1985 in conjunction with the Daily Mirror. Space precluded us from reproducing it in this month's Searchlight but you can read it here on our website and make up your own mind about the BNP's criminal hypocrisy. The British National Party will be fielding a total of 21 candidates in London on 10 June although some of them are doubling up. As Searchlight went to press the party had named candidates for all 11 London-wide seats in the London Assembly, a mayoral candidate who is also standing for the Assembly and a full list of nine for the London constituency in the European election. The BNP website includes photographs and short biographies of the party's candidates around the country except that, with four weeks to go until polling day, some photos and several biographies for the London candidates were still missing. This may be because many of the candidates' past activities are rather embarrassing for Nick Griffin's new "clean" BNP. The many candidates with criminal convictions and a penchant for the policies of Hitler's Third Reich reflect how poorly organised the BNP is in London. In pole position on the London European list is Chris Roberts. Not a serious choice, this former alleged City high flyer has been described as a man from some village that is missing its idiot - and this was by a fellow BNP member. He is the brother of the notorious Barry Roberts, who is number 2 on the London Assembly list. Whereas Chris lives in leafy Essex and has long abandoned London, his brother still resides in southeast London where he grew up in the company of the openly nazi and violent British Movement and the National Front. After belatedly turning to the BNP, Barry Roberts was among those who guarded a meeting addressed by the arch liar and Holocaust denier David Irving, alongside leading violent members of the nazi terror group Combat 18, such as Charlie Sargent, who is now serving a life sentence for murder. \nChris Roberts is very coy about his early politics but a rumoured early link with US extremists may account for his love of the USA and his abandoning of the5	Can someone tell me the score from soccer aid last night please?  2-1 to england\nferdinand scored 1st\njonny wilkes scored 2nd\nand maradona scored a penalty for rest of world1	If someone got cancer from a toxin in their drinking water, what type of cancer would it be? Technical, scientific answers only please. No guesses. The reason I ask is because I knew a family who had 4 out of 6 members end up with cancer with two of them dying from it over a period of 30 years. They each lived in the house for various periods due to the fact that one of them was a child of the family who grew up and got cancer later in life. Both of the original couple got it with the husband dying from it. The second husband got it and the original wife eventually died from it. They all had various types of cancers. Also I live in a state where cancer is prevalent, but certainly not that prevalent to happen to that many members of a family.----- They drank well water. As previous answers suggested, different "toxins" affect different body systems.  As a result, you cannot predict what kind of cancer one could get without knowing what kind of "toxin" was ingested.5	Is Labron James really that great or is it all hype?

Please, don't mention the Civil War, as it was not a war about freeing slaves for the sake of freedom. Why are wars fought?  It is a philosophical question not a political question.  Think about it for a moment.  Why would anyone kill or risk being killed in massive numbers.  History is littered with dead soldiers and dead causes.  It defies all logic to run towards gunfire or to press forward after experiencing casualties.\n\nWars are started by politicians.  Wether it is a king, president, general, dictator, etc., it is a small group making the decision and thrusting others into the fray.  This is the case with Iraq.\n\nAs a native Mississippian living in Alabama, I am familiar with the blood that was shed for black America.  It was shed in Selma, it was shed in Money, it was shed in Jackson, it was shed in Philadelphia, it was shed in Memphis, it was shed in Birmingham, and a whole bunch of cities and towns no one talks about and many can't remember.  The civil rights movement was a fierce struggle.8	First Date restaurant? Ok girls help me out here! I just realized I always go to the same sushi place for all my first dates. It is wrong?

Depends how you define "first."  Columbia was the first to fly in space.

The construction of Challenger started before that of Columbia, even though it was the second one to fly in space.5	what is the difference between Caliber and Bore of a gun? what is the difference between Caliber and Bore of a gun? and why are the bullets of guns in wierd sizes such as 5.56mm and 7.62mm Unfortunately, explanations of caliber and bore can differ, depending upon your particular purpose (even within the context of firearms).\n\n   Caliber, as a standard of measure, is given in tenths of an inch, though for technical purposes, thousandths of an inch are also given. Some will state that this later case is not correct.\n\n Example:\n   an M1 Garand fires a bullet having a diameter of .308"\n   an AK-47 fires a bullet having a diameter of .311"\n   They are both referred to as being .30 caliber rifles.\n\n   The bore of the gun is the inside of the barrel (like a "hole," it's not actually anything concrete, but where stuff is missing) it can also refer to the inside walls of the barrel ("there is rust in the bore")\n\n   Most barrels have rifling, which is also described as "Lands and grooves" the lands are the areas sticking up, and the groves are the areas pressed (or cut) away.\n   If you imagine a cross-section of a gun barrel now, you would see something like a circle with a "gear tooth" edge. (remember that the metal is on the outside of this shape, not inside it) You could draw one circle touching the tops of the lands, following the inside shape (cutting off the teeth), and one circle touching the bottoms of the grooves (making the circle as big as the teeth).\n   The diameter of the smaller circle (measured from the tops of the lands) is the Bore Diameter. It is the largest round thing you could pass through the barrel, without having to miss-shape it to make it fit.\n   The diameter of the larger circle (taken from the bottoms of the groves) is the Groove Diameter. This represents pretty much the largest thing you can pass through the barrel, and whatever you push through it, will be cut, or pressed into by the lands of the barrel sticking up, in its way. Bullets, for the most part, are this diameter.\n   Caliber USUALLY refers to this larger size, and thus, too the diameter of the bullets used in the barrel too.\n\n   To give an example (I think these numbers are correct, but I have not verified them):\n   If you have a .30-06, the bullet 308/1000 of an inch (.308") passes through the barrel, which has a BORE of .300" and a grove diameter of .308".\n   If you have a .50 BMG, the bullet .510" passes through a barrel with a bore of .500", and a groove diameter of .510"\n\n   Unless you are involved in some technical aspect respecting firearms, most people will use the bullet's diameter "Caliber" to describe both the barrel and the bullet, because one number for everything is much easier for everyone involved.\n\n\n   As for bullets and weird sizes, I'll add to that: Why do they use numbers that don't reflect anything accurately?\n   You will find, in many cases, that weapons firing bullets of seemingly similar calibers, even if from different cartridges, are, in fact, the same caliber bullet. Markets usually don't reinvent the wheel. The .30-06, .308, .300 Win Mag, and .30-30 (I believe) all use the same .308" standard. similarly, 6mm and .243 cartridges are using the same caliber, and most center-fire (not rim-fire) .22s are using the .224" bullet. These include the .22-250, .220 Swift, .223 Remington (aka 5.56mm x45/NATO) and more.\n   I've always found it interesting to note that, while it makes sense to round .308" to a nice, round "thirty," that the actual metric equivalent to that is 7.82mm, and that the no-less-complex 7.62 is simply a nice, round "thirty" in inches.\n   Despite what I state here, if you're dealing with foreign cartridges, you will often find them using similar but different actual diameters. (the British .303 is something like .312" and the AK-47 is .311" I believe)\n   Also worth mentioning is that the .38 is a .357" and the .44 is a .429". Sometimes they're not that close.\n   The best advice I can give you9	when boris johnson became an MP which tory grandee's seat did he take over?

A RNA virus is usually the one which has either single or double stranded strands of RNA & are usually the viruses which affect & cause majority of the infections in the world by affecting either animals, plants & humans. HIV is one such example. DNA viruses on the other hand may have a single or double stranded DNA & usually are less infectious than the RNA viruses. However, both can cause life threatening diseases. \nIn either cases a virion which is the dormant/nonliving,passive form of the virus which is nothing but RNA/DNA wrapped in a protein coat & carrier of it on finding a suitable host will infect it by attaching to a specific receptor on the host cell. \nAfter infection, only the RNA/DNA of the virus enters the host cell & replicate via various mechanisms using the hosts machinery & energy for repliction, sometimes involving a suitable intermediate. When sufficient copies of the RNA/DNA have been made, the virus lyses the host cell & finds other host cells killing the previous host cell. Sometimes the virus may even get replicated with the host cell itself by incorporating ita DNA with the hosts DNA & this is called lysogeny. \neg of DNA viruses.-- Herpes Simplex virus\n"  " RNA Viruse-- HIV virus.5	who is Jose Lima's first wife?  some woman1	Need help in building a small dam (about half a foot in height) to prevent erosion of soil? In the place where I live, during rains the ground besides me becomes a small stream. What that does is that it erodes the soil and the place becomes very uneven after monsoon. So every year we have to bring truckload of soil to fill the small gorges. So this time I built a small mud dam but then during heavy rainfall the water flows over it and takes the soil with it. So what should I do so that the soil does not get eroded or water doesn't flow? And for ur information the place has a slope of about 10-15 degrees several courses of action should be taken.\n\nif there is no alternative to the slope, then you should force the water to go a longer distance, and make the slope smaller, like a down hill skier.  reducing the slope and putting in many bends will slow the water down more.  \n\nupstream, a retention pond should be put in, or a sizable pool that will fill with water, slow down the water, and really delay the water form heading downstream all at once.  although if you have monsoons, this may not have maximum effect.\n\nduring the dry season, plant in the streambed and beside it where the water goes.  try to use plants that are typically in or near the water or the stream.  this will slow the water down, and the roots will help hold onto soil to keep it from washing away.\n\nafter these options, a small dam could be put in.  start by placing wooden or metal poles in a line, slightly bowed out going upstream, across the stream bed.  from there, place wooden or metal poles laid down across the perpendicular poles.  then place the soil on top of that.  in the middle of the dam, you will want it open in a v shape going up the dam, to allow water to still pass through.  a v shape will allow the little bit of water to pass when it is dryer, but more to pass when it is wetter.  ideally you should put a layer of concrete over the dam to stop it from eroding, but if not, then just pack it very tightly and put more plants right into the dam.\n\nthough some of this sounds expensive and time consuming, will save in the end if you dont have to truck in the sand.\n\n\n\nif its part of a road, use cement/ brick/ mudbricks over the section that water flows on.  if its a short section, see if it would be possible to install a culvert (pipe) so that water will flow under and not over the road.\n\nwithout additional information, i can only suggest rocks and boulders in the area to slow the water and prevent erosion.  other techniques that you can research that are more specific to your situation may be found on a yahoo search, or if you have some money, invite an engineer (geotechnical or civil) to the site if possible.0	do u have a prob.....? why is it that MOST (not all) ppl cant stand mormons?

Dear Parvinder,\n\nIn Singapore, there is an Act called the Enlistment Act (Chapter 93 of 2001), within this act is a Section Part III titled National Service which covers various broad details like who is eligible to be called up (those above 18 years of age) and how long they would serve their full-time national service (not exceeding 2 years with some exceptions listed usually a promotion in ranks with a cap of not more than 2 years and 6 months of service).\n\nInterestingly the act does not state that National Service is only for males, but at the moment, the authority authorized to make the decision has only called up males for National Service (this implies that statutorily, if the authority decides to call up females it can do so).\n\nNot everyone will qualify or need to serve, as the statute also require that the persons called up be checked for fitness to perform national service, but everyone called up will still need to report for registration and the check for fitness before they are officially informed of their start of their national service.\n\nNational Service in Singapore is not restricted to the Army only, depending on the needs of the authority, the selected personnels could serve in the Armed Forces, Naval Force, Air Force, Police Force and Civil Defence Force.\n\nIn short, yes National Service is mandatory for those who are called up to perform the service.\n\nBut being a mandatory service, the statutes also provide for some additional coverage in terms of protecting the rights for those called up for service. For more details you might be interested in another Act called the National Servicemen (Employment) Act - Chapter 202 of 1985. This aims to protect those who are asked to serve the country from losing their jobs and ensure that they are able to go back to their work place after performing their national duty.\n\nThere is also more information about National Service for Singapore that can be found in a portal build for national servicemen called the NS portal, this can be found at www.ns.sg\n\nIn general, even after completion of the fullt-tme national service, there is still a need to serve part-time national service (usually on an annual basis), for non-commissioned officers they are not expected to serve beyond 40 years of age, for commissioned officers not expected to serve beyond 45 years of age (but there are some citizens who volunteer their services for longer periods) - the age limit is basically an upper limit you can find more information from the NS portal.\n\nFor more details about the citations please see the link below:2	where is the "G" spot of the men?  seminal vesicle and prostate gland. one is just slightly above the other. massaging and stimualting while masturbating or having sex can increase the intensity of your orgasm as well as increase the quantity of your ejaculation.4	How to create a Flash form to send email without any knowledge of ASP, PHP or any other programing languages?

Zinedine Zidane, Soccer Player \n\nBorn: 23 June 1972 \nBirthplace: Marseille, France \nBest Known As: The MVP of World Cup 1998 \nA flashy midfielder, Zinedine Zidane won the Golden Ball as the most valuable player in the World Cups of 1998 and 2006. Zidane played his first professional First Division game for Cannes in 1991 and quickly rose through the professional ranks. He sealed his reputation by scoring two goals in the World Cup finals of 1998, helping France defeat Brazil to claim its first-ever World Cup championship. Zidane played for professional powerhouse Juventus from 1996 until 2001, when he was acquired by Real Madrid for 46 million pounds, a record fee. (By 2003 his teammates on Real Madrid included superstars David Beckham, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, among others.) Zidane was named FIFA player of the year in 1998, 2000, and 2003. He retired from professional soccer after leading France to the finals of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nZidane's nickname is "Zizou"... In his final game, the 2006 World Cup final against Italy, Zidane was red-carded out of the game for a bizarre headbutt to the chest of Italy's Marco Materazzi. Italy won the game and the World Cup on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw. However, Zidane was still named the tournament's most outstanding player. He claimed he hit Materazzi in retaliation for insults made about Zidane's mother and sister; in September 2006 Materazzi said he had grabbed Zidane's shirt during play, causing Zidane to remark that he would give him the shirt if he liked it so much, in turn prompting Materazzi to respond, "I'd rather have your sister." Materazzi further claimed he didn't know Zidane had a sister until after the incident.4	i want techniques of latest software and also i want best players , best anti virus softwares ,best dictionary  try VLC media player\n\nFor antvirus : AVG free Antivirus\n\ndictionary: Online: answers.com\noffline: wordweb9	In the state of Illinois, how can I create a will if the person is too incapacitated to sign it?

I think I'd cry. =D I'm super-sensitive to these things. I cry at the happy parts in movies too, so of course I'd cry at my friend's weddings. =D\nIt's sort of the change in a person. It's knowing that they won't be the same again. That they don't 'belong' to you anymore. They're somebody else's. Weddings are worth the tears. And in answer to the email you sent, yes it was...good. It was good to let out the tears and just stand there,crying, looking at this beautiful view of two people very much in love. It was nice to cry and be able to let them out without feeling ashamed. It's not a bad thing to cry at weddings. Many people do so.\nI cry even at birthdays. Think about the buckets I'll cry at weddings. =D2	what can cause depression ?  waking up and knowing that bush is still the president.9	Shouldn't illegal immigrants be given a chance?Why do people hate them as much as wanting to kill?

Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.3	Is this good?

Film, music, int. business are among the majors and careers i am interested in. does anybody have any advice and suggestions for where i should consider going? personal experience? Usually studying abroad requires being a part of an American university for at least a year before you are accepted into the SA program. Often, after taking a few classes and learning a little about what programs are offered through your particular school, you'll have a more clear idea. You will probably also be required to take at least one/two semesters of whatever language your instruction will be in while in the foreign country, so that's something to consider. Look at your local colleges; many have programs that are connected. Bretheran Colleges have a program that connects 6 colleges across the US and offer study abroad programs in over 11 countries. Many Lutheran colleges have similar programs. Cal State schools find it harder to get funding than private universities, so you might consider that as well. My last recommendation is to visit your local Community colleges and see if they have a bulletin board or some sort of advertising space that may offer short-term study abroad options. If you like the program enough in a short amount of time and make friends/connections wherever you study, you might find it easier to find further opportunities there.\n  I have lived in Germany, Greece, England, and South America with different study abroad programs my whole life. Each culture is different, interesting, and wonderful and you'll enjoy wherever you go, as long as you have a healthy frame of mind before you leave!4	can somebody see what you're surfing if connected by router? i'm receiving internet connection through a router from my neighbour's house. can he see only the IP addresses that i'm visiting or even more specific details (example: if i visit wikipedia, will he see only the IP address of wikipedia.org or can he also see the articles i'm browsing through?) Depends.  If it's just a standard router, he won't have a log of anything.  If he would have a proxy server (unlikely), he could be logging everything you do.\n\nMy suggestion, quit being a theif, and stealing internet access, you can actually be charged and convicted of a crime doing this.

To make a long story short, I ran into a girl that he was friends with a while ago and he contacted her shortly after we broke up I guess. She works at our local mall. He told me that he only saw her once at the mall and ran into her- that was it. They never hung out or anything. She’s told me differently. This girl has no reason to lie to me, she’s religious and I’m starting to think I believe her more than I do him. She says they stopped talking because he was irritated with her one night and that was that. I guess she was paying more attention to her cell phone than to him. She said they hung out a few times.It wasn’t so much of what they did or didn’t do together, it’s the fact that he lied to me about the situation. I feel like I cant trust anything he says no. What do I do? Do I confront him about it? We’re having our first baby this April. I'm so lost. Confront him, but don't make a big deal out of it, because it's not like he cheated on you!1	Why are saltwater fish not salty tasting? What is the chemical/biological process of saltwater fish that makes them unsalty?  What's the chemistry that makes this synthesis happen?  I'm guessing part of it starts with plankton and algae down the food chain.  But there still must be some processes that fish have that makes them not be salty. Most vertebrates have their own internal milieu, that is, we maintain constant concentrations of ions and water that are different from those of the environment. This is achieved by means of the osmoregulatory system, which includes the kidneys but also, in the case of fishes, special excretory tissues in the gill area.\nSome fishes (cartilaginous ones) do indeed maintain a high internal concentration of salts as part of their osmoregulatory mechanism:  it's not sodium chloride, however, but urea, and therefore their meat is stronger-tasting and has a salty smell.0	When learning spanish, what sort of things should i be aware of in conversation?

What is the things that keeps you from being all you can be?\nFrom being a complete being?  a complete spiritual being?\nIn General as "Human's...what is our true enemy?\n\nWondering what people feel or think in the Core of their souls, is ultimately the source of what is continuously keeping them down, from fullfilling their dreams, aspirations, and completion of their mission here on Earth. Try thinking differently on this subject. Think of the person you call enemy as someone whose intentions you dont yet understand, and think of negative thoughts as choices arising from mental confusion about your own intentions. You and I and everyone else, there are no enemies, only misinterpretation, so if you find yourself hating something, like a thought, or someone, like the person on the street with the exact opposite attitude toward life, attempt to determine why you could possibly be choosing these thoughts, or look at it from their point of view, and one of 2 things will happen:\n1) you'll stay there dumbfounded, working really hard at trying to determine first cause and fail, and by that time the stimulus that prompted such hate will have passed, or\n2) you'll work out how you/they came to such a conclusion, and correct your attitude/thought pattern or see the person as someone who is an individual, with different dreams, goals and aspirations in life that are taking them down a road of choices and consequences that would seem unconscionable from your point of view. This mindset, when used will open doors for you, as you begin to see people as friends that before you would have labeled enemies. Even your inner enemy will be silenced by the power of your intention.1	how much of force is required to push an object vertically to 7 mts if the object weighs 7 kgs?  "push to 7m" or is that push through 7m\n\nif you are pushing against gravity  the force required is mass*acceleration due to gravity, which is 7*9.8 = 68.6 newtons\n\nHowever we are making two assumptions here, \n1. that acceleration due to gravity is constant at 9.8, which is only true at sea level at the equator, and is different everywhere else, 10m/s^2 at the poles for instance. Moreover g changes negligibily during the course of the movement through that 7 m also. \n2. resistance due to friction, air resistance are completely absent\n\nIt is also important to note that once a force slightly greater than 68.6 newtons is applied, the body starts moving upwards and keeps moving until an opposing force is applied. so to move through exactly 7m, u need to apply a force in the opposite direction to stop the object7	Its an old one!?

I know foods can explode in the microwave, especially if there is fat or oil in the food, so I always cover food when I cook it. Yesterday I was heating a mug of plain water, and after about 90 seconds of heating it I heard a terrific BLAM. I turned off the microwave, waited 10 seconds, and then when I looked inside, most of the water was all over the inside of the microwave with only about an inch left in the mug. What's the scientific explanation behind the explosion of plain water? Super-heating is correct, but you'd also like to know why it's more likely to happen with a microwave vs. hot plate. In addition to having to be above the boiling point, in order for an actual bubble to form, there needs to be a small particle in the water, or imperfection (such as a scratch) on the surface of the cup for the bubble to form around. This is called "nucleation". If you heat water on a hot plate, the water gets hot enough to boil first on the bottom surface, where there are usually lots of microscopic imperfections, and the bubbles form right away. In a microwave, though, the waves ignore the cup and heat the water directly. If the water has been filtered, the temperature can climb significantly above the boiling point away from the surface, but not have any way to boil. Since the cup itself if not being heated, it acts as a heat sink, absorbing heat from the water near the surface. That means the water at the surface can actually be cooler (below the boiling point) than deeper within, where super-heating occurs. The slightest jostle or thermal convection, though, can transport superheated water along the surface, or excite any incipient nucleation points that do exist in the bulk water, causing bubbles to form. Since the water is so hot there, the bubble forms explosively.1	what is morse code?  copying wikipedia articles is cheating.  Morse code is a military system of pulses used to communicate letters.

Once in a while a BIOS flash fails or, for any number of other reasons, your BIOS becomes corrupt, you will find that your system will not boot. With newer BIOS releases you may receive a screen that the AWARD BootBlock BIOS is attempting recovery and that it's searching for a diskette. For example:\n\n\nAward BootBlock BIOS v1.0\nCopyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc.\n\n\nBIOS ROM checksum error\n\n\nDetecting floppy drive A media\n\n\nWith older BIOS' (and at other times) your system will appear to be dead, with the exception that it attempts to boot from the diskette drive and then hang.\n\nIn the above scenarios, your BIOS is probably corrupt and the system is attempting to read the floppy. In these cases the BootBlock is attempting to recover your BIOS. The BootBlock is a portion of the BIOS which will sometimes boot when the BIOS itself has been corrupted to enable you to boot to a floppy and reflash. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn order to attempt the reflash, prepare a DOS boot diskette with no CONFIG.SYS (remember: if you prepare a boot diskette in Windows, CONFIG.SYS may be hidden by default, so it will be necessary to change your view settings in order to see it).\n\nDownload the latest BIOS for your board and unpack it into a work directory on another system's hard disk. You'll get as many as five files. The two you are interested in are named xxxxxx.BIN (replace xxxxxx with the name of the BIOS .BIN file that you are attempting to flash) and AWDFLASH.EXE. Copy these two files to your DOS diskette.\n\nCreate a single line AUTOEXEC.BAT on the diskette containing:\n\nAWDFLASH.EXE xxxxxx.BIN /CC /CD /CP /F /R /PY /SN\n\nNote the spaces after .EXE and .BIN and before each "/" in the above command.\n\nPrior to flashing with your recovery diskette, remove the power cord and open up your computer (you're going to need to crack the case after the flash anyway in order to manually clear your CMOS). Disconnect all drives, except your floppy drive.\n\nSeveral users have reported back that they were able to recover from the BootBlock when advised to disconnect everything except the floppy drive.\n\nTo flash with this diskette, place the floppy in drive A:, power up your system and (hopefully) after several minutes your system should reboot itself. When your system reboots, press DEL at the POST screen and shut your system down. Because your BIOS was corrupt, you should clear your CMOS settings manually using the following procedure:\n\nRemove the main power cord.\nRemove the motherboard battery (optional).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper (CCMOS1 on Abit boards) from pins 1 and 2 to pins 2 and 3.\nPress your power switch several times to discharge any remaining power from the motherboard.\nWait a minute or two.\nReplace the motherboard battery (if you removed it).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper back to pins 1 and 2.\nReconnect your drives.\nClose up the case.\nRestore the power.\nPower up and press DEL during the POST to get into the BIOS setup screens and reenter everything.\n\nIn order to properly detect your CPU and memory, remember to start your reentry of BIOS settings with the selection of Load Optimized Defaults.\n\nDon't forget to remove the diskette (or you'll likely boot to it and run the flash all over again).\n\nYou should see what's happening on the screen with new motherboards. With many older boards, you will be running "blind" unless you have an ISA Video Card installed in your system.\n\nIf nothing happens and your floppy doesn't start to access after a few minutes, power down and try again - sometimes it takes several attempts to force the BootBlock to start running the flash.\n\nThe AWDFLASH.EXE command modifiers used above are:\n/CC = clear CMOS data after programming.\n/CD = clear DMI data after programming.\n/CP = clear PnP (ESCD) data after programming.\n/F = use flash routines in the BIOS for programming (force flash).\n/R = reset s1	How do i draw an MO energy level diagram for HCCCN?  basic MO diagrams only look at one bond at a time, and usually only diatomics.\n\nyou'll have to draw one for the CN triple bond, one for the CC single bond and one for the CC triple bond.  it is unlikely that you'll have to do the CH bond, though it can be represented in MO too.\n\npage 24 on this PDF (www.upei.ca/~chem342/Resources/ Reviews/Molecular_Orbital_Tutorial.pdf)  shows a MO diagram of CN(-).  this will be similar to your case, except one set of lone pairs on the C will be used in the CC single bond...\n\nthis is an odd quesion because normally polyatomics are represented using hybridization...4	After installing Ram cd drive not working?

The US government is corrupt because of the Jewish Politicians (some, not all) who have such great power that they influence the media and our own government into thinking that Palestinians are bad. However if one actually looks at the rest of the world, one will realize the most countries do not support Israel. Jewish political power in America is unassailable, as it had become in Germany before Hitler.  Hitler's solution was the only answer there and then.  It resulted in what he called the Jewish War - WW11.  Because he lost that war, everything he said is now called wrong.  In time, history will vindicate his opinions, unless politically correct hypocrisy succeeds in permanently smothering the truth, as it has done up to now.\nThe terrible mess in Iraq, called a war, is very certainly a Jewish war.  Israel is the one and only country which benefits from it and it was Israel which caused it - or, for the benefit of the brain-dead majority who will read this, the American support of Israel.  It was, dear dumbos, this support which turned the Islamic world against America, culminating in 9/11, which in turn caused the Iraq attack.0	I know there are people you wouldn't  kick out of your bed, but who would you kick out of your bed??

I have a DSL connection and i share it with another system. I want to disconnect it without unplugged LAN wire & without unchecked my DSL connection to sharing i.e without change IP address on Server system. i assume you don't have a DSL router - which would be the best solution.\n\nIf you want the client machine to stay connected to the internet, you have to keep the server machine connected to DSL and keep sharing the connection. Alternatively, you could just plug that client machine into the DSL, but you'd have to set it up to login or whatever and, if you have some sort of DSL modem, you may need to restart it.\n\nOf course, that opens your second machine up to the usual internet dangers of port scanners and such.\n\nLike I said before, the best thing would be to get a DSL router that connects to the DSL where you could connect any machine to the DSL without it being dependent on any other machine, and you can set up the router to open certain ports so that a web server or Quake server can still work.1	what is the best way to build a egg drop container for a school project? my 5yr old son has to do an egg drop project. how do we build a container and what do we need We did some contest in school, and the container that won was a really easy build polystyrol(that white stuff around new TV etc) box.\n\nhttp://www.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/upload/buildingmaterial_picture/17/picture/EPS.jpg2	I have a huge blister on the side of my foot, probably from running.?

My mom is making me get braces and don't get me wrong i want to got them but I need to know more about them. My dentest is telling me that it doesn't hurt but everyone I know is telling me it does hurt.So who should I bealive? I had them... it DOES hurt. If your teeth are crooked though, it's worth it. Mine weren't though, and my orthodontist ripped off my mom because he made her believe my teeth would EVENTUALLY become crooked. Riiight. When they came off, they looked exactly the same as they did when I had them put on. They really do hurt, though. They'll tear up the insides of your cheeks, and it will hurt so much everytime they tighten the wires. You should try Invisalign, or something.\n\nlol They definitely DON'T look cool either.

No I don't do drugs. I fly in my dreams all of the time.  It started when I was very young (5) I am now 42.  I learned a lot about out of body experiences and astral travel.  The Sylvia Brown book is good and also Doreen Virtue "lightworkers" book.  It is good to learn about these things so you aren't afraid.  I can control my dreams now (lucid dreaming) and it is great.  Try keeping a notebook and pen by your bed and jot them down.  Do you hear sounds or feel spinning before you take off?  These are signs of astral travel.  There is much to learn about dreamtime out there.  Explore and have fun!1	why are sharks teeth white? and not yellow. I mean they dont brush them. Tooth enamel is naturally white.  Animals that have discolored teeth get that way because of the things they eat.  Generally animals with permanent teeth (mammals) that eat vegetable matter will have the most discolored teeth due to the tannins (same substances that make coffee and tea stain human teeth) in plants.\n\nAs there is nothing in flesh to stain teeth (blood doesn't stain enamel) carnivores tend to have whiter teeth.  \n\nBut with sharks (and other animals that constantly shed their teeth) the teeth never have the chance to get stained as they are replaced so often.2	what is cushings syndrome?  (m)\n\nCushing's syndrome or hypercortisolism or hyperadrenocorticism is an endocrine disorder caused by excessive levels of the endogenous corticosteroid hormone cortisol. It may also be induced iatrogenically by treatment with exogenous corticosteroids for other medical conditions. It was discovered by American physician, surgeon and endocrinologist Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) and reported by him in 1932.\n\nCushing's syndrome is also a relatively common condition in domestic dogs in which causes are the same as the syndrome in humans.4	What do you like better ims or myspace?

He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do?

I also feel for you and your situation.  Here's my advice:\n\n1. Find a male friend of his, a councilor or possibly your pastor that he can work with to solve his drug problem.  YOU DID NOT CAUSE THIS PROBLEM!! and YOU CANNOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM! Read those two lines again and again.  Realize that you do not believe these two absolutely true lines.  \n\n2. Stick by him by allowing him to take responsibility for himself.  There is nothing wrong with telling him you love him and wish him well in his own recovery, but that you will NOT be the one to get him off drugs.\n\n3. Do NOT stand for any abusive yelling, name calling, or threats!  You do not deserve this type of thing and no one does.  Do not stand for this for one second!\n\n4. You may need to move out temporarily so that he can put his life back in order without blaming you.  Do not do this in a moment of anger, but in a moment of love.  Tell him you have faith in him and you will be there for pleasant phone calls.  But remind him that you cannot solve his problem.\n\n5. You may need to council with your pastor or with a professional so you can understand the truth of the situation.\n\n6. You need to repent to your husband for 1) allowing him to manipulate and talk unkindly to you and 2) for trying to shield him from the consequences of his actions.  These things have made him less able to change.\n\nGood luck my friend.\n\nJ6	If I am 18 y.o., Where should I invest my $300? I would like to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or just put it in a savings account, but I don't know which one. 2 Choices:\n\n1) Open an Account with Sharebuilder.com and invest the money on Shares in either Anheuser-Busch(BUD), Walmart (WMT), Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific (CP.) or Toyota (TM) - Sharebuilder are alot cheaper than other traders because they buy the stocks for their clients in one bulk block every week and split them between the clients (instead of lots of individual $1,000+ trades with a $10 commission fee)...... because of this it also allows you to buy fractions of stocks in a company e.g. you stick $100 on stocks in a company with valued at $200/share you still get 0.5 shares in that company.\nBefore investing in stocks..... learn everything you can about them.\n\n2) Invest in some gold bullion - either in bar or coin form.1	How happens the equilibrium between predators and preys?  predators and prey have a relatively simple relationship. If there is not enough prey the predators must compete too much and die off a bit. if there are too many predators the prey dies and then the predators follow. if there is too much prey the predators multiply until there are too few and then die off. if there are not enough predators and too much prey the prey will die of natural causes such as disease and starvation due to overcompetition for food \nso an equilibrium is really nonexistent, there is a constant state of change4	what is cto pricing level for software licenses?

This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.4	Is there any way to mount NTFS partition in read-write mode in Linux?

Those spare air canisters that are used for scuba can you buy those without a scuba liscence? For snorkeling in fresh water? How long do they last? Good question actually. A reputable dive shop shouldn't be selling them to a non certified diver. They have a reg similar to that used on a set of normal regs, which require some training on, to be familiar with it's use and limitations. You also need to be familiar with how a compressed gas works on the body and some of the physics involved.\n There are a couple of sizes of spare air, so gas volume will be part of how long a can will last as well as the depth it's used at.\n Mine is the 3 cubic foot (largest I think) and allegedly holds 50 typical breaths when used at the surface. This number goes down substantially when you  hit 2 atm and so on. About 25% per atm approximately. I don't think they are what you want, for what you intend on doing. They are refillable, but I don't think the cost is worth it for you overall. Mine's sole purpose is to get me out of a tight spot, should the need arise.

They would have quality wins over Arkansas, Nebraska, Oregon, California, and Notre Dame.  The difference between Michigan and USC in the BCS as of 11-18 is very small, so with a win over Notre Dame, they should leapfrog Michigan.  But, if USC does not win out, it would be either Florida or Michigan.  Florida would have to win big against their rival Florida St. and then win the SEC title against a good Arkansas team.7	what was the name of the first 12" single?

It is supposed to be a bacteria that contains a whole eco system, is that true , more details TUESDAY, Oct. 11 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have developed an antimicrobial coating that can be chemically bonded to gauze bandages, socks and hospital bedding and gowns to prevent the spread of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe coating, which kills the two most common and harmful kinds of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that cause infections in hospitals, works by blocking the bacteria's ability to reach and re-colonize wounds. Bacteria should also have a tough time becoming resistant to the coating, which was designed to thwart such resistance.\n\n"These technologies are especially timely given the threats that are facing the American public, such as antibiotic-resistant bugs occurring in hospitals across the world. This has the potential to be used widely," Christopher Batich, a University of Florida (UF) professor of biomedical engineering and one of the coating's inventors, said in a prepared statement.\n\nClinical trials of the coating in gauze will be conducted at UF later this year.\n\nEach year, nearly 2 million people in the United States contract infections while they're in hospital, says the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause about 70 percent of those infections.4	Internet Trojans? I have a secure PC.

I myself am a agriculture major with a Master's degree. I have a few friends who are in the field of Botany and Plant Pathology (it studies the diseases plants can get) Here are some materials for your thinking.\n\nIf you think you like to do research, going to grad school at least for Master's degree is necessary. As a Botany major, you can work as a researcher/research assistant. Schools like UC Davis, UC Riverside, Cornell, Purdue, Texas A&M,etc, have great research labs to work at. You can also work for USDA (Department of Agriculture). They have many many experimental stations in almost every state. At such environment you have more chance to work with local farmers or agro industry while doing research. Some people like this better than pure research in universities.\nBesides, you can also work as a plant breeder for private seed companies. Teaching at college level is also an option after you finish the grad school.(Be sure to work as a teaching asistance before you graduate. This gives you good experience-you get to teach while experienced professors are suprovising by your side)\n\nSince you have not decided your major, I would suggest you to work in a research lab in Botany or Horticulture, just to know what life is like working in this field. You'll know if it's for you soon after you work there. Good luck and have fun!0	Why Allah Abrogated many verses with new one,Does Allah forget or improve his commands?

Can he seriously contend for the heavyweight title, or will Vladimir Klitchko outbox him easily? He is certainly huge. The thing that makes Nikolai Valuev such a difficult opponent is that he also has a great jab. (Unfortunately, I have not been able to see it myself since his fights haven't been televised in the US to the best of my knowledge.) This, combined with his reach advantage, is enough to keep the distance against most opponents at the same time as getting in some pretty good offense.\n\nIf (and that's a big if) he gets to fight Wladimir Klitschko anytime in the near future, he would definitely give Wlad some problems. Of course, Wladimir isn't a small guy himself, though he would still be giving up a good half foot in height. The problem for Wladimir is that he also relies heavily on the jab, so that reach advantage (though not so great as Valuev has over other fighters) could become a major factor. I'm not really sure how this fight would go.\n\nI do think Sergei Lyakhovich has a definite shot against Valuev, though, because of his stamina and athletic ability. If Valuev gets tired, Lyakhovich would be able to take complete control of the fight.\n\nSince Valuev already has the WBA title, he's up there with the semi-name fighters already. I don't see his next opponent Owen Beck posing much of a problem for him because of his size, but I would like to see him against any of the current top heavyweights. Valuev is still undefeated with 43 wins (31 by knockout), so it would be very interesting to see if and how any of those other top fighters manage to get past him.9	how many marines have died in iraq since "mission accomplished"?

I am only 35 years old. I have extreme weakness, dizziness and chestpain. My blood pressure was 74/45 yesterday and 92/55 today. I went to the emergency room but they sent me home saying the infarction wasn't a big deal. I get scared I'm gonna pass-out. As every one has mentioned that Infarc is a term for heart attack. It can be mild or major. If they sent you home then chances are that it was an old infarc and that you had no clinical indications for being there, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS YOU NEED TO BE RE-EVALUATED. a blood pressure of 74/45 is cause for major concern if you do not normally have low blood pressure. You need to be seen and followed by a cardiologist.  Saying that it was no big deal is WRONG. Especially at 35. \n\nYou need a full work up including laboratory, stress test, and possibly cardiac cath (if testing shows nothing but a possible old MI INSIST ON THE CARDIAC CATH, my best friend was 33 with some cardiac issues considered minor. she had a thallium stress test that revealed nothing, a week later she had a Major MI at work that she did not survive.

I had a talk with a friend who had broken up and she recently revealed to me that she got hit by her ex-bf. She and that guy had been dating for one year and a half and lived with him for one year. She still blamed herself for being hit and until today, her ex still stand strongly that it was her that caused him to hit her. Basically he shoved her while they were arguing about something and although she got hit, she never really bruised ( thats why I didnt know she was hit). Her ex told her that he was never the violent person and he had never ever raised his hand to hit any women and blamed her for being the psychotic one. Btw, it happend twice.  I think everytime it started when he was being controlling and she couldnt take it and try to stand up for herself. I have never been in a domestic abusive relationship and i dont know what to tell her. Can a person be blamed for being hit or made someone hit her? I met her ex and he seemed like such a nice person! Men who do this frequently appear to be awesome people (think Ted Bundy, the all american boy turned serial killer)...  It is absolutely NOT her fault, and he's using that as an excuse for his own inability to control his impulses.2	Please take this seriously!?!? ladies? Ok, here is my issue, please take this seriously!  i am 14, I wear like deordorant and everything but by the end of the day my underarms are all sweaty and it shows on my clothing.  I am not even doing anything just sitting and listening to teachers and nothing else.  I dono why i keep sweatng and its not like i am nervous or anything, i just do! How can i stop!?!?!? i use "Speed-Lady-Stick 24/7" deordorant, could it be the brand? i dono just please help! Use a product called "Certain Dri." I think it's either in the deoderant section or medicine section. It's as strong as the ones that doctors prescribe, but u dont need a prescription. It's doctor recommended too. Don't worry. Excessive perspiration is normal. I have it and it used to show a lot and smell even tho I wasn't doing anything either, but then I heard about this product. U must continue to use ur regular deoderant, but use certain dri at night. It's this roll on liquid that u roll onto ur armpits right before u sleep. It minimizes the size of the pores in ur armpit so u sweat less. Try it! I'm sure it will work for u. I spent years wearing triple layers of t-shirts to try to hide the sweat and smell. Not anymore! It's available at almost any store. Try walgreens or walmart.\n\nP.S.\nIt doesn't matter wat deoderant u use because they don't work. I've tried secret (it's the worst! it  doesnt even help at all!), Mitcham (which actually stops u from sweating, but it smells really bad), Dove (weak!), and now I'm on Ban (it's ok). Just use any deoderant u want, but make sure u use Certain Dri at night. It has worked for millions of ppl including me. There are NO side effects.9	how many fast attack submarines are there?

Pooja, you are baiscally on the right track. You choose the longsest chain. It can sometimes get tricky to choose the longset and there is where organic chem can get a little tricky.\n\nOnce you have identfied the longest chain, you need to see how much H "connection" are there.\n\nThe next step is to see the relationship between H and C.\n\nIf it is a 1 to 1 relationship, you have to keep in mind certain implications.\n\nIf however, C is more than H you need to know that you are dealing with heavy compounds and this as I'm sur you nkow, needs to be dealt with diffrently.5	Who will win the FIFA World Cup this summer?

It’s hard to say which are the best. It usually comes to personal preferences. If yours are the Kangaroo Leather and price under $80 I would suggest Adidas Predator Pulse. After Adidas released new version – Predator Absolute, these great cleats could be purchased for under $100 (about $80-$90 in some cases). Also Adidas has other Kangaroo models for less than $80:\nF50 TRX (2004 model), Aveiro and Copa Mundial.\n\nIf, for some reason, you don’t like Adidas brand, there are couple good choices within Diadora cleats:\nCarioca RTX 12 and Carioca MD 25 (about $40 – probably the least expensive Kangaroo cleats on the market).\nUnfortunately if you prefer Nike or Puma, all theirs Kangaroo cleats are over $100 (Nike produce only one Kangaroo model – Air Legend).\n\nYou can read more on how to and what factors to consider while selecting soccer cleats at4	Does anyone like watching Documentaries?

Some of these answers would be funny if not for the thought y'all believe it. \nAnyone wear a BELT? Next time you see someone wearing a belt notice how they jump and spin and hop around. :-D \n\nThere is a flank strap. it is NOT a rope tightened around the genitals - that is a false statement by people who have never been to a rodeo. If they had they'd see it's not a rope - it's a leather strap usually with fleece on it - basily a belt. It is well in front of the genitals. \nFurthermore - there is a way with ropes if it's tightened enough it touches nerves and renders the animal unable to move. This used to be done to work on animals on farms before cattle chutes were routine. If it were TIGHT ropes the bull would be unable to move. \nThe strap does not hurt them...it makes them buck higher. That's it. They're bred to buck and bred for attitude. For the brief time they are bucking there is absolutely no harm done to the animal.2	can I get pregnant in between ovulation periods? if my ovulation date was on April 29 and my next ovulation date isn't til May 27 can I still get pregnant in between then? Your egg is only viable for about 24 hours after ovulation, but sperm can live for about 3 days in your vagina.  The problem with "ovulation dates" is that you can't depend on them.  Your body reacts to stress and other factors which can cause you to ovulate early or late.  The best way to tell you are "ripe and ready" is by your cervical discharge. When it looks like egg whites (thick, clear or whitish, and stretchy) you are ready for insemination.  You can check your cervical discharge with a finger inserted near your cervix or (for the squeamish) by checking your tissue after you wipe.4	free computer security software?

I'd like to purchase a telescope for my 30 yr old son, would prefer quality, within a decent price range,we live in Arizona where the sky is always beautiful. He would be a first timer but he is educated, am I better off buying used? what accesories? Where can I go to research this type of item?I don't want plastic pieces, something he may be able to take with him totravel up in the mountains. thankyou for any advice you can share. MOMSRAGE4 There are lots of possibilities, depending on your son's interests, and what you consider a "decent" price range. A small dobsonian telescope is a good starter scope at a reasonable price (~$250 - $800). Meade Lightbridge dobs are built a bit better than the entry level ones and disassemble for better portability (~$500 - $1000).\n\nFor a more high-tech, computer controlled scope, the Meade LXD75 series (~$900 - $1400) is a good place to look. Various Schmidt-Cassegrains from Meade and Celestron ($1000 - $5000 & up) are another possibility.  Astromart is a good place for used scopes, as it's used mostly by serious amateurs. Avoid eBay unless you really know what you're looking for - a lot of junk there. \n\nThe links below are a few places to browse, plus the Yahoo telescopes group where you can find some informed opinions about astronomical equipment.4	are colleges good places to work in?

There is no visual difference. Sound quality, unless of course you're tone deaf.

If you play alot afterwards you'll need tuning more often.\n\nIn this case it's sound, not sight.2	I'm thinking about getting Porcelain Veneer done on my teeth..has anybody had it done before? Whats the Cost?, Side effects?, How long do they last? If you can get acrylic its less expensive and more durable. You'll still have to get them replaced in about 10 years, but the risk of breakage is less.\n\nMy EX-dentist had convinced me to use porcelain. I should have known better than to go to someone who was proud of his celebrity clientele. The veneers were hand made in a lab, which I had to go to in person so the labtech could check for himself shade and shape.  It was overkill--it felt like I kept going back for visits both to the dentist and the lab week after week until it was finally done....When it was done, I could see the blue-grey tinge of the metallic post underneath the porcelain, and it was NOT attractive. \n\nThen within three years one of them cracked and fell off! I was already very careful with them (hardly ever biting with them if I could avoid it) so I was really upset. I had to find a dentist quickly and the new dentist got the job done in just two visits, using acrylic--not porcelain. It looks even better than the original and it was a fraction of the cost (hundreds vs. thousands)\n\nSo research who you use and compare costs--try the website below--and if you do decide to do it, don't let anyone talk you into getting something way more involved and expensive than necessary. \n\nGood luck!3	why student must be equipped with leadership training before entering higher education life? - what the use of leadership training?  \n- what the suitable leadership training that can be learn how we can apply this kind of skills after entering college?\n- what the different and advantage between the student who have this skills and who haven't?

I want to know what to expect now.  He is turning 66 years old in August. anyone give me some info I would greatly appreciate it. Hepatitis C is not as bad as it sounds. You can get treatment for this. As long as he doesn't drink alcohol he can get a liver transplant if worse comes to worse.\n\n\n\nspeaking, hepatitis is any inflammation of the liver. Although it is often caused by a virus, other causes may include alcohol, medications that have a harmful effect on the liver, toxins, or autoimmune disorders.\n\nIn total, there are at least 7 known viral hepatitis strains: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Of these viral forms, hepatitis C may be the leading infectious cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world, affecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Hepatitis A, which is not blood-borne, and hepatitis B, which is blood-borne, are also very widespread. Only these viral forms of hepatitis, including hepatitis C, can be spread directly from one person to another.\n\nExamples of nonviral forms of hepatitis include alcoholic hepatitis (caused by excessive drinking), toxic/drug-induced hepatitis (caused by inhaling or swallowing certain toxins or medications such as acetaminophen), and autoimmune hepatitis (which occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own liver cells).\n\nTo learn about hepatitis C, including its causes, how it develops, and how to prevent its spread, see What Is Hepatitis C?\n\nTo learn more about hepatitis A, click here.\n\nTo learn more about hepatitis B, click here.\n\nYou may also want to visit Role of the Liver to learn more about the liver and how hepatitis affects this organ.\n\nAbout Hepatitis A\n\nHepatitis A, often abbreviated as HAV (hepatitis A virus), is extremely prevalent (widespread) in the U.S. population. In fact, 1 out of 3 Americans has been infected at some point. However, most people who are infected with hepatitis A recover completely without treatment and, once the infection has subsided, develop lifelong immunity to the disease.\n\nHepatitis A is transmitted primarily by the fecal-to-oral route through contaminated food or water, or because of poor hygiene habits. Hepatitis A can also be contracted by eating shellfish from contaminated water sources. In the United States, people who live in communities with high rates of hepatitis A infection are considered at risk for contracting the disease.\n\nPeople who are infected with hepatitis A generally develop flu-like symptoms, such as low-grade fever, aches, and mild abdominal pain within 10 to 40 days after exposure. In some individuals, these flu-like symptoms can be followed by jaundice (a yellowing of the eyes and skin). Hepatitis A is an acute condition and most people clear the virus on their own without treatment. However, in fewer than 1% of cases, severe acute infections may lead to liver failure and to a need for liver transplantation. Hepatitis A does not lead to the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.\n\nA vaccine is available to protect against hepatitis A. It is recommended for anyone who may be going to an area where there are increased rates of hepatitis A, including Mexico, Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The vaccine is also recommended for people who might become seriously ill if they are infected with the virus.\n\nHepatitis A can be avoided by washing hands with warm water and soap, particularly after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing and eating food. Good hygiene practices are particularly important for anyone who works with food.\n\nFor more information about hepatitis A, including risk factors and prevention, see the Support Library section.\n\nAbout Hepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B, often abbreviated as HBV (hepatitis B virus), is transmitted through blood or blood products, through sexual contact, or from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 1.25 million people are infected with hepatitis B. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 30% of people who a5	If you were down 3, bases loaded, what MLB slugger would you send to hit?(If you had a choice)?

A few very late manuscripts add in heaven—the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one."\nBible manuscripts that were written prior to the Eleventh Century C.E (A.D.) read quite differently. So, it appears as though this verse was changed about 1,000 years after John penned it by someone who wanted to provide scriptural backing to the Trinity doctrine.\nWhen reading John the Fifth Chapter, the three witness-bearers are the water (baptism), the Breath (Gr. pneuma – the Breath of God), and the (shed) blood (of Jesus). Changing the water, the Breath, and the blood to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost would make the rest of what John wrote illogical; so that rendering is totaly false. Trinitarians love to regurgitate philosophy, Greek, , and quotes from other Babylon-loving Trinitarians. When Trinitarians dishonestly quote the spurious version of 1 John 5:7, they are merely quoting the human work of a trinitarian, rather than the godly work of the apostle John or of the divine Author.\n\nBy contrast, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Scriptures alone quite plainly demonstrate that Jesus and the Almighty are separate distinct persons, and the Almighty created Jesus as His firstborn son.\n\n(Colossians 1:15) the firstborn of all creation\n\n(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: 'Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.\n\n(Revelation 3:14) the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God\n\n(Philippians 2:5-6) Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God\n\n(John 8:42) Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth\n\n(John 12:49) I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself who sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak\n\n(John 14:28) I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am\n\n(1 Corinthians 15:28) But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him\n\n(Matthew 20:23) this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father\n\n(1 Corinthians 11:3) I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; ...in turn the head of the Christ is God\n\n(John 20:17) I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.\n\n(Deuteronomy 6:4) Jehovah our God is one Jehovah\n\n(1 Corinthians 8:4-6) There is no God but one.

I heard somewhere that the Bears have a lot of problems at the moment that might affect them.\n\nI think the Chicago game is gonna be tough for the Jets - but they can pull it off cause they are now my favourites for winning the AFC playoffs for the superbowl.\n\nWhat do you think?

I am thinking about getting him for my fantasy baseball team, due to his 14 stolen bases, but the main thing I aqm concerned about is he is up there is age, so my question is, since I prefer a long term solution, would it be wise to grab Roberts off the free agent list and hope for no injuries or would I be better off finding someone else? and if so, pls through out a couple of suggestions.\n\nThank you Roberts is hot right now, so get him while he is still racking up steals. He's on pace for 66, but don't count on that. He's usually good for 30+, though, and I think that's what he'll end up with. Some better long-term solutions that might be available in your league are Felipe Lopez, Chone Figgins and maybe even Ryan Freel. Roberts is halfway to 30 steals already and may only give you 15 more while Figgins and Freel are around 10 steals and should finish with 30+. Lopez is leading the majors, so I doubt he'll be available in your league. But grab Roberts while he's still hot and when he starts to cool down, grab one of these other guys.0	What is the Mason's secret handshake?  There are different handshakes actually.

What is an exponent?\nHow do you find one?\nWhat is scientifical notation?\nCan you give me an example and website to study?\nThanks this will come in handy in my next couple of MATH lessons! Hey,\n      An exponet is how many times you mutiply the base. Meaning, if you have 3 to the fourth exponet, you will do this, 3 x 3 x 3 x 3, which equals 81. Scientific notation is hard to explain, but the best way is like this, mostly scientific notation has to do with 10's, for ex. 1.06 x 10 to the 7 exponet/power. Is all you do is move the decimal 7 places to the right, but when it is negative like this, \n1.06 x 10 to the -7 power,  you move the exponet to the left, well i hope that i helped you out!, C ya2	Yoga??????? Ok, I would like to get rid of stress. Someone suggested yoga. However, I am NOT limber. Should I still look into it? Yoga is union. Yoga is not just physical (Hatha) but complete union, enunciated in its 8 branches, so beautifull by Patanjali.\n\nAnyways, on more practical terms: Yes, yoga, the union is necessary for stress relief, achieving freedom from thoughts.\n\nYoga is union... of what with what? Within is an arrangement since birth: Kundalini (Divine Feminine) and Atma (Spirit) which are separate and need to unite to create the joy and bliss. The fallout of this yoga/union is bliss, relief from all concerns, pains and tensions.\n\nThe Kundalini needs to traverse the path of the central channel before touching the spirit which resides in the physical heart. \n\nOne exercise, a guided meditation I can recommend is by H.

I never know how much to tip.  Someone told me she tips $1 for every two bags but that is just ridiculous in my opinion.

I've tried a few websites but...still not getting it...from what I understand the point is to bring oxygen and nutrients into the medulla (which has higher metabolic needs than the cortex). The reason the vasa recta loops is so that sodium taken in/water taken out by the descending vasa recta can be reversed in the ascending vasa recta, thereby not changing the osmotic gradient in the medulla. Is there more to it than this? Just seems too easy LOL. Thanks! Blood entering the interstitium in the vasa recta is\n300 mosmol/l. As with capillaries elsewhere, these capillaries are\npermeable to salt and water.\n\nAs blood flows, in the vasa recta, from the cortex to\nthe medulla, it equilibrates at each level with the\nsalt and water which is drawn in from the\ninterstitium by the net inward pressure (15mmHg).\n\nAs the blood returns to the cortex, the same\nprocess of equilibration occurs. As the blood leaves to enter the venules, its osmolarity is about 310 mosmol/l., just slightly\nhyper-osmotic with respect to plasma.\n\nThe vasa recta continuously take away a\nsmall amount of salt (osmolarity of 310 vs 300) and\nwater from the interstitium but do not dissipate\nthe gradient.7	Does anyone know a website to download free Toy-box(name of the artist) mp3s?  limewire9	How can Republicans regain the support of the conservative movement without being labled as exstream .?

Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing, but so far only one of these is close.  That is this one:  ( the real answer is at the bottom please read on.)\n\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears "The Green and Gold", although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\n\nYou will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby, the Socceroos of the World Cup, and the Olympic team. \n\nSource(s):\n\nwikipedia.org \n+++++ \n\nReal Answer:\nThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD... (Not Green and Gold, Green and Yellow, or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up.  If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution ( not that many of obviously have or have the ability to) you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold... the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree. \n\nNow before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself. Also take the time to read it (if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed..) \n\nI hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that..7	Dose Simon Cowell Still work for BMG records?

I need to know who the national england soccer team coach is and a little about him...Is he old? LONDON --Steve McClaren wasted no time distancing himself from Sven-Goran Eriksson."I'm going to do it my way," McClaren said Tuesday when he officially became England's 11th national soccer coach.\n\nHe assumed control exactly a month after England was eliminated in the World Cup quarterfinals by Portugal, ending Eriksson's 5 1/2-year stay. McClaren's term also began almost 40 years to the day that England won its only World Cup.\n\n"It will be totally different from Sven and his five years," said McClaren, the former Middlesbrough manager who was groomed as Eriksson's assistant. "I'm looking forward to the big challenge."\n\nThe 45-year-old coach signed a four-year deal in May after Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari turned down the job.\n\n"It's a new chapter in the life of the England national team," said Brian Barwick, the Football Association's chief executive.\n\nMcClaren was hit with an early setback in one of soccer's most taxing jobs when former England captain Alan Shearer last week rejected an offer to work with the team, choosing to concentrate on his TV job.\n\nMcClaren still hopes to land former England coach Terry Venables, who left after leading the team to the semifinals of the 1996 European Championship.\n\n"I will look to make a few changes and freshen a few things up," McClaren said. "The aim is to try to bring the whole nation closer together, to bring the England team closer to the clubs and the fans."\n\nMcClaren was asked when he would appoint a captain to replace David Beckham, who stepped down after the World Cup. Chelsea's John Terry and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard are the leading contenders.\n\n"Individuals and smaller details we'll get to later on," McClaren said.\n\nMcClaren's first game is an Aug. 16 exhibition against Greece at Old Trafford. England hosts Andorra on Sept. 2 and travels to Macedonia four days later in the first qualifiers for the 2008 European Championship.\n\n"It won't be difficult for Steve to impose himself," Terry told The Times of London from Chelsea's preseason tour in the United States. "Every manager is different and Steve will be really different.\n\n"Sven was a little bit quiet and Steve will be in your face a bit more, which some of us like to see. We like to see that passion which he has in him and hopefully that will rub off on us."\n\nMcClaren was a midfielder at Hull City, Derby County, Bristol City and Oxford, where he turned to coaching youth and reserve teams. He became Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United during the very successful years of 1999-01.\n\n"One thing that makes him a good coach is he's lucky," said Jim Smith, who recruited McClaren to coach Derby. "But he's a very talented coach and very good at man management. He knows what the best footballers are all about and gains their respect."8	fine then, i will just have to end my pathetic life.

Because all they see is the tv, nintendo or pc. Blame their parents.  Monkey see, monkey do.  If the parents are active and creative then the children will be too.  I see this in very young children.  My kid is 16 mos. and loves to watch (and chase) birds, pick flowers, throw balls, play on the swing set, and 'read'.  When she goes to the daycare for an hour while I work out she plays with the toys (what a novel idea!) while most of the other kids her age are zoned out to the boob tube.

Why is it that people think it is ok to eat meat when there ARE ALTERNATIVES to killing animals just for our consumption and use? I think it is selfish. Plus meat is bad for you. There is a very healthy substitute for every meat, so what are people thinking? Ughhh, I don't know why people do. It is rancid. Who wants to actually eat another animal? It is so last century to be a nasty carnivore.\n\nPlus why should all of the animals suffer when there are alternatives?

Would it still exist? There's a whole new school of literature that's developed in recent years, callled, "What If" fiction (What if the South had won the Civil War. What if the Nazis developed atomic weapons. Etc.). \n\nYou've raised a very interesting "What if" yourself. You probably should have kept this idea to yourself, written a Best Seller, and gotten a fat Hollywood contract for the film rights. It's quite interesting... I'll have a go.\n\nThe "Kingdom" would have definitely lasted until Washington's death. But since Washigton had no heirs, it would have left a power struggle for the succession. Thomas Jefferson, fresh from his heady experiences during the French Revolution would have been pushing for the disestablishment of the monarchy, and the establishment of a republic.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, on the other hand, would have been politicking hard to secure the position for himself (or possibly John Adams, who DID have male heirs). It is altogether possible that the US would have blown up in a Civil War over this (Monarchists vs. Republicans). At this point anything could happen. But let's assume two things: that the monarchists won the battle, and that the basic constitutional rights of the people were preserved in the Bill of Rights.\n\nIf we accept both of these, I think in the long run, the monarchy would have been disestablished and replaced by a republic. As America grew in the 19th century, the population moved westward. It was far more independent minded, less inclined to be deferential, and altogether wedded to notions of basic equality. And I think that old Jeffersonnian spirit would have appealed to them more and more. The "Republican" party would become more popular, and eventually, I believe, the monarchy would have been disestablished.\n\nBut of course, that is only one scenario of many possible outcomes. \n\nGreat question.

His second son wants to do the same thing , and I am sure that as children grow, they benifit from diversity, and as they grow they usually come away from it, I think kids are lucky to have parents who allow them to experience different avenues.\nThey grow up with an attitude that allows them to seek out things in life, and to be a little bit wiser as they were allowed to grow with their own identity and individualism.\nAnd hopefully they will allow their kids to grow in the same way, instead of forcing our ideas on them.\n\nDon't worry!!\n\nRegards Bill.\n  (pa69oldfart)7	Can anyone provide the complete lyrics for Peggy Seeger's "Legal Illegal"?

Anyone can take classes at a community college without a high school diploma. Only very smart students can be accepted to a university without a diploma through "early admission" (that is, if the university offers this option), and then the high school requirements are completed using the college classes. \n\nSince you are not proficient in writing English, you can check out your options at your local community college, where you will need to pass proficiency tests before taking college level classes. However, most community colleges also offer remedial classes, but those don't count for college credit.\n\nP.S.

Well basically in osmosis, there are 3 solutions: hypertonic,hypotonic and isotonic. Drinking saltwater causes a hypertonic solution in your cells. The most basic way to explain this is as you drink saltwater, the salt solutions gather outside your cells. No water comes in and the remaining water gets pushed out causing crenation, shriveling of the cell. You can see it externally when your hands wrinkle when wet for too long right? Imagine it acting through your internal organs so I think its kinda like dehydration from within, which is exactly what people try to avoid  when they drink saltwater out of desperation right? hehe.9	I need information about the requirment to joining a SWAT Team in Texas?

How many fish did he catch each individual day? Let's denote the number of fish he caught on day 1 as x.  Thus, here are the totals for each day:\n\nday 1 = x\nday 2 = x+3\nday 3 = x+6\nday 4 = x+9\nday 5 = x+12\nday 6 = x+15\nday 7 = x+18\nday 8 = x+21\nday 9 = x+24\nday 10 = x+27\nday 11 = x+30\nday 12 = x+33\nday 13 = x+36\nday 14 = x+39\n\nAdding these together will get you the total fish = 385.  Solving, you get:\n\n14x + 273 = 385\n\nSolving, you get x = 8\n\nThus, these are the totals he caught each day:\n\nday 1 = 8\nday 2 = 11\nday 3 = 14\nday 4 = 17\nday 5 = 20\nday 6 = 23\nday 7 = 26\nday 8 = 29\nday 9 = 32\nday 10 = 35\nday 11 = 38\nday 12 = 41\nday 13 = 44\nday 14 = 47\n\n---------------\n\nHope this helps4	Why did I lose my old 'tool-box ' area on top, after installing  the 'new' Internet Explorer 7? . . . . . .My "internet settings" utility box, etcetera, no longer seems to be available. . .  where did it go. . . .

I understand that christians believe that having an abortion is murder, but why should a woman be forced to carry and raise the consequence of such a horrible crime? This is where I have said, you need to walk in someone elses shoes before judging that person. It's between her and GOD, not what we think. Yes, it's wrong and I could not do it, but I'm not going to hate that person or get on her case if she was raped and really wanted to go through with it.0	In Boston, public anger has still not abated in the high-profile case of Cardinal Bernard Law, ....? who acknowledged that as long as 18 years ago he made "wrong decisions" in keeping a pedophile priest in parish work. (See his letter to the archdiocese at the ZENIT Web page <http://www.zenit.org/english/> .) Within a year of arriving as archbishop of Boston in 1984, Law had shuffled Father John J. Geoghan to another parish, even though the prelate was aware that the priest had been abusing children for years. After abusing more children, Geoghan was removed for treatment, but then reassigned -- only to continue his preying on youngsters. Court allegations say he abused 130 or more children before defrocked in 1998. Cardinal Law has refused to resign over the case. "My resignation is not part of the solution as I see it," he told a group of more than 500 priests at a conference Jan. 23 in Boston. "I want the archdiocese to become a model for how this issue should be handled." Yes, the whole situation in Boston was terrible. \n\nThe bottom line of it was:  Cardinal Law acted like a business manager, or a lawyer, or someone else whose primary goal was nothing but damage control.\n\nHe didn't act like an apostle.  \n\nThat's why he listened to psychotherapists who pronounced Geoghan and other abusive priests "cured" when they definitely were not "cured" and never would be.\n\nIt's why he listened to lawyers and insurance providers who advised him to make secret financial settlements while shuffling abusive priests from parish to parish.\n\nIt's why he capitulated to society's politically correct view of homosexuality -- and allowed known gay priests to continue to sexually prey NOT on young kids, but older boys past the age of puberty.\n\nPlenty of blame can be passed around here -- on the psychotherapists, lawyers, insurance guys, apathetic laity, and on a politically correct culture that sees nothing wrong with the homosexuality that was displayed by the vast majority of priests guilty in this scandal.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the archdiocese of Boston was run by Law.   He handled this situation very poorly.   \n\nI have no doubt that the Church has learned a very hard lesson, and will not let the errors of the past be repeated -- by returning to its orthodox roots.9	Will Bush resign before the Dems get there and take all his secret files with him?

Currently Wi-Max has superseded Wi-Fi, what is next to it which can cover wider area with high data transfer (e.g HSDPA, UWB) seamlessly? It looks like HSDPA is getting more popular, with data transmission rates of 4 to 5 times that of current generation 3G networks (UMTS) and 15 times faster than GPRS.\nAnd UWB can deliver data rates in excess of 100 Mbit/s, while using a small amount of power and operating in the same bands as existing communications without producing significant interference. However it is not limited to wireless communication, UWB can also use mains-wiring, coaxial cable or twisted-pair cables to communicate - with potential to deliver data faster than 1 gigabit per second.\n\nThough it looks like HSDPA is getting more popular, we may need to wait for a while to see which one of them will integrate into daily life seamlessly.8	What's a good idea for a romantic birthday present.?

My son (8yrs old) was attacked by a neighborhood menace whose 9yrs old and knocked out his adult front tooth. The police said because he was 9 he could not be charged. They said if he was to be charged he would be charged with Simple Assault so basically he got away with it. He makes fun of my son, gets other ppl to bother him because of it. He also got in trouble with the police for shoplifting at the unimart. To top it off, he shows no remorse by making up a rap song that goes .. IM A G .. IM A G .. THE COPS CANT TOUCH ME! I STOLE FROM THE STORE MY MAMA DID NOTHING TO ME!\n\nI was so upset when I heard this. He gets no discipline at home and now has moved to another part of the state.

Been back n forth to the dentist because the filling they put falls out. He has also been made fun of in school and feels sad all the time.\nHelp Im a sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem.

Liniment, from the Latin linere, to anoint, is a medicated topical preparation for application to the skin. Liniments are of a similar viscosity to lotions (being significantly less viscous than an ointment or cream) but unlike a lotion a liniment is applied with friction, that is a liniment is always rubbed in.\n\nLiniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscles or from arthritis. These liniments typically are formulated from alcohol.\n\nNow Horse liniment is Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). While DMSO has a low toxicity, prolonged exposure can cause dermatitis and possibly damage the liver or kidneys.\n\nIt is commonly used as a liniment for horses, although its use in humans is controversial.4	how do u know when an e-mail is sent?  if u have yahoo! mail...the emails u send are automatically in ur sent folder and have the time and date @ the top of the email...9	i want to change the spelling of my name without having to do a name change. how do i go about doing this?

A pendulum is formed from a small ball of mass m on a string of length L. There is a peg of height h = L/3 above the pendulum's lowest point. From what minimum angle theta must the pendulum be released in order for the ball to go over the top of the peg without the string going slack?\n\nAny ideas?\n\n\nThanks I wish there was some way to include a drawing in the answers.\nStarting from the end, we want the bob to complete a vertical circle about the peg. The radius of this circle will be L/3. The minimum velocity to complete the circle is given by\nv = sqrt (5*g*r) = sqrt (5*g*L/3).\nHence the KE of the bob at the lowest point is\nKE = 1/2 m*v^2 = 5/6 m*g*L. \nThis must be equal to the PE at the beginning of the swing.\nPE = m*g*L*(1 - cos theta).\nThis gives cos theta = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. Thus the required angle = arccos 1/6 = 80.4 deg. \nFor the derivation of the min velocity for completion of a vertical circle, pl refer to any standard text book on Mechanics.5	Please tell me a website with goldberg wallpapers?  type in GOLDBERG ito google image6	Points on here.?

Certes c'est la course la plus dure au Monde. J'ai participé à la Vuelta cette année et ce n'est pas si médiatisé que ça. Pourquoi? Le Tour est si médiatisé parce que c'est la course qui réunit les meilleures équipes et les meilleurs coureurs du monde. Pour la Vuelta ou le Giro, seuls les espagnols et les italiens envoient leurs meilleurs éléments. Sur le Tour, les leaders de chaque équipe toute nationalité confondue sont présents.\n\nLe fait que la course se déroule en juillet est aussi un avantage pour ASO. Les spectateurs sont plus nombreux et les télespectateurs aussi. Pour les deux autres GT, il est difficile de les suivre quand on travaille. Donc il y a moins d'audience et la couverture médiatique stagne.\n\nDe plus, on entend souvent dire que c'est sur le Tour que se sont forgés les plus belles légendes. Et en général, je pense que l'on retient mieux les vainqueurs sur le Tour que ceux sur le Giro ou la Vuelta à long terme.\n\nEnfin, et çà il n'y a que toi qui pourra me le confirmer, l'objectif / le rêve de tout coureur n'est-il pas de remporter une étape sur le Tour ou mieux de s'y imposer?1	what is a ten sided object called?

I took a pregnancy test and it was negative, but i still haven't started my period.  It isn't unusual for me to skip a period, but this is the first time i have skipped one while being sexually active.  I am not scared to be pregnant, i would actually like to be, but i just don't understand. There are many reasons why a period could be missed including diet, stress, pregnancy, infection, and hormonal balance.  As pregnancy blood tests are the most accurate, it is best to have one done 2 weeks after a missed period.  If it turns out to be negative, then your doctor can do further testing to see what's going on.3	Does anyone know any websites that have info on Poverty in Eritrea?

That depends on what you would consider integrated.  If you mean can COBOL call Java routines at runtime or vice versa, not easily would be my answer.  You would have to do some very detailed object compilations and hand linking to get the critters to work and play well with each other at all.  On the other hand, if your definition of integration is that they share a common data set at different times for specific reasons, they could quite easily be considered integral parts of a larger system.  COBOL, for example, being run once a day to do mass backups and create total files for a day's business and Java applets and applications being used while the business is actually conducted to create or update current sales and business files over an Intranet.

My son's girlfriend lives with us so she can go to this school system, which I agreed to.  Last night my son came and told me her mother wanted me to take her to the doctor, so once again I agreed.  The girl is supposed to be on medicaid.  Well, the mother sent us up there knowing that her insurance was no good yet and of course they wouldn't see her, just told her to come back when medicaid got straightened out, and to have her medicine renewed until then.  Well, we called her mom to see what she wanted me to do about this, things just kept rocking on so I told her I would take care of it.  Well, when we got in the store she called me back and told me she was coming to get her daughter if I had a problem with her.  I just told her she needn't be so b***** about this and to do what she had to do and hung up on her.  Now she called my son and told him she was coming to get her daughter.  Should I apologize to keep her from hurting him?  Personally, I could care less what the woman does. If the medication was for birth control(forgive me for thinking this, it is a suspecious world), your son should be responsible. If not, it is up to her parents to take care of her medical expenses, Sounds like she is attempting to suck you blind. Don't let her. Sounds like the mother has issues. Why is she on welfare insurance, does she work? Doesn't she sound like an honorable, full fledged co-dependent? Don't get me started on this type of personality. \nPlease help the girl as much as you can and give her as much love and support that you can give her. She has gone through situations like this all of her life; she must be humilated. Your poor son is included in the problem. Those poor children need you to be the adult and do what you Know is right. Why not sit down with the kids and ask them how they feel. After listening to the two of them, the answer will come. You do not have to ask them what to do because the answerw will come to you. Even if the answer seems unjusst to you, maybe you will have to ear crow. You are such an honest person, you will know the WILL OF GOD.\nNow, back to the sibling thing. I had four sisterss and one brother who I grew up with. About three years ago, I quit trying to please them. I call them on birthdays and they call about family dinners. That is about it. THANK GOD. \nI no longer have the burden of attempting to please my siblings. Three years ago, I told my oldest sister the truth about everything in our lives. She, threw a fit as usual and attempted to start a fued again with the siblings. That time, I did wipe my feet of her and her bulling. She would not let me visit her on her death bed a year later. As cold as it sounds, I did not morn her death. To me, she died at the time of our last conversation-fight. \nTo be honest, we probably all felt bullied by her, she was an athusist, alcoholic(recovering),and disloved everyone. The list of her problem go on and on. The fact that God allowed me to finally stand up to her and he did not take her without me setting things straight with her. I never stood up for myself and I am so thankful that I was given permission to do so. Thanks for listening. It is over and done, but the bruses will always be there.

You first in some way need to let the girl know that your interested in her. Try being just a little outspoken.

His father was an Orthodox priest.\n\n He was born in Smiljan, Lika, then part of the Austrian Empire, today in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nSo, he was a Serbian born in nowdays Croatia.\n\nthe next includes some info of his origins. You can find it at http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm\n\nNikola Tesla (1856-1943) - Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia, which at that time, lay within Austro-Hungary. Tesla was born "at the stroke of midnight" with lightning striking during a summer storm. He was born in Smiljani near Gospiæ, Lika, (the Krajina, a military district of Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in Croatia). At the moment of his birth, the midwife commented, "He'll be a child of the storm," to which his mother replied, "No, of light." Tesla was baptized in the Old Slavonic Church rite. His Baptism Certificate reports that he was born on June 28 (Julian calendar; July 10 in the Gregorian calendar), and christened by the Serb orthodox priest, Toma Oklobd'ija. It is interesting to note that he was a Serbian of Valachian descent. Tesla was proud of his Croatian motherland and Serbian descent. When his mother died in 1892, he paid a visit to Croatian capital Zagreb, and gave a lecture about alternating current. On that occasion Tesla said: "As a son of my homeland, I feel it is my duty to help the city of Zagreb in every respect with my advice and work"  - ("Smatram svojom duznoscu da kao rodeni sin svoje zemlje pomognem gradu Zagrebu u svakom pogledu savjetom i cinom"). Nikola Tesla, besides being a great inventor and an outspoken Serbian patriot, had sincerely adored free Serb states, Serbia and Montenegro. He had never hidden his patriotic feelings, on the contrary, he stressed them.\n\nOn June 1st 1892, Tesla arrived in Belgrade due to a call for assistance from the Belgrade municipality. Several thousand people were there to greet him at the Belgrade train station. He addressed the gathered crowd, who saluted him: "There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity. If those hopes would become fulfilled, the most exiting thought would be that it is a deed of a Serb. Long live Serbdom!..." Tesla further said to the students of Belgrade University: "As you can see and hear, I have remained a Serb overseas where I have done some researches. You should do so and by your knowledge and hard work you should glorify Serbdom over the world."\n\nI copied some tekst just for the official informations, but Serbs claim that he is Serbian and Croats that he is Croatian....2	Why would I be producing more saliva.

Which is your favorite actress ?  demi moore in about last night!2	Health question here?? Need answers? I work on a tug boat.  I have a very unusual schedual.  My sleep paterns are very unusual at work.  I go out for 20 days and work 6hrs on and 6hrs off.  I am home for 10 days and have to adust to normal life.  I some times take xanax to help regulate my sleep so I can stay more intune with my girlfriends schedual.  I love her very much but i often feel guilty that when i'm home I turn her schedule completly upside down.  I often dont wont to go to sleep because of anxiety or maby the fact that i'm away so much i'm afraid I'm gona miss out on somthing.  I've been doing this for almost 12 years and make very good money.  I know she loves me as well.  This is very hard on both of us.  We have a great time when I'm home but It also brings alot of stress on her.  Some times I can stay up for 24 hours strait without it even phasing me. I think this is due to my job because often i have to pull these kinds of hours.  xanax helps but I'm sick of being fuzzy headed and druged.  Any good advice? Please consider trying other things besides Xanax to help you sleep and to reduce your anxiety.  For one thing, Xanax is very addictive, and is not recommended for long term use.  For another, it's really not the most effective sleep aid, if that's how you are using it.  \n\nI have two recommendations for you and I hope you will at least look in to trying them.  I have tried both and would swear by them as they have worked wonders with both anxiety and insomnia.\n\nOne of the best things I've found that helps me go to sleep at night is a supplement called melatonin. "At night melatonin is produced to help our bodies regulate our sleep-wake cycles. The amount of melatonin produced by our body seems to lessen as we get older. Scientists believe this may be why young people have less problem sleeping than older people."\n\nIt has other added benefits like strengthening your immune system. You can buy it at your local health food store, a GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, or online at any vitamin store. It HELPS you get to sleep, it doesn't knock you out or anything, and it doesn't leave me with that "sleep hangover" you get from Nyquil.\n\nAs far as anxiety is concerned, a doctor recommended that I try taking the supplement GABA, and I have not had problems with anxiety since then. I have found that it makes me feel calmer and more in control without feeling stupid, sleepy, or drugged. I would strongly, strongly recommend that you give it a try. i have also tried valerian root and did not find it particularly beneficial, but the GABA has truly worked wonders. I have since heard from other friends who have had similar problems, and some of their doctors have also recommended they try GABA.\n\nI wish you the best of luck.4	i have a lexmark all in one printer,no disc 2 download it 2 my computer,how do i do it?

Depending on what state you live in.\n\nSome states have laws that can hold someone responsible for manslaughter if they furnished the illegal drug to the "victim".\n\nYou will need to contact your local prosecutor and find out the law where you live and see if the crime was committed.\n\nBut, if your friend died just because he was using drugs and not something furnished to him by the other party, that party can't be held responsible just because he happened to die at his home.\n\nSorry for your loss.1	what is science and technology?  Both science and technology imply a thinking process, both are concerned with causal relationships in the material world, and both employ an experimental methodology that results in empirical demonstrations that can be verified by repetition (see Scientific Method). Science, at least in theory, is less concerned with the practicality of its results and more concerned with the development of general laws, but in practice science and technology are inextricably involved with each other. The varying interplay of the two can be observed in the historical development of such practitioners as chemists, engineers, physicists, astronomers, carpenters, potters, and many other specialists. Differing educational requirements, social status, vocabulary, methodology, and types of rewards, as well as institutional objectives and professional goals, contribute to such distinctions as can be made between the activities of scientists and technologists; but throughout history the practitioners of “pure” science have made many practical as well as theoretical contributions.\n\nIndeed, the concept that science provides the ideas for technological innovations and that pure research is therefore essential for any significant advancement in industrial civilization is essentially a myth. Most of the greatest changes in industrial civilization cannot be traced to the laboratory. Fundamental tools and processes in the fields of mechanics, chemistry, astronomy, metallurgy, and hydraulics were developed before the laws governing their functions were discovered. The steam engine, for example, was commonplace before the science of thermodynamics elucidated the physical principles underlying its operations.\n\nIn recent years a sharp value distinction has grown up between science and technology. Advances in science have frequently had their bitter opponents, but today many people have come to fear technology much more than science. For these people, science may be perceived as a serene, objective source for understanding the eternal laws of nature, whereas the practical manifestations of technology in the modern world now seem to them to be out of control.1	Why do we become sea-sick?

Sir Isaac Newton. Beyond question, it was his work as a theorist.  The story about the falling apple is about as apocryphal as the one about George Washington and the cherry tree.\n\nTo appreciate what Newton did, we must realize that he came after Kepler and Galileo.  Kepler, using Tycho's observational data, formulated three laws of planetary motion -- ellipses, equal areas in equal times, and the cube of the orbital radius equals the square of the period.  He did <not> explain why these laws obtained.  That was left to Newton.\n\nGalileo was a great experimenter, observer, and theorist.  His work with the inclined plane and falling objects produced g, the acceleration due to gravity ... but Galileo did not have the calculus, which explains instantaneous motion.  That was left for Newton.\n\nBecause of Kepler and Galileo, Newton had all the data he needed.  His great work -- all theoretical -- was to explain the results obtained by Kepler and Galileo.  Newton's three laws of motion -- uniform linear motion, F = ma, and conservation of momentum -- are all theoretical constructs which, when coupled with the calculus (his invention) and applied to "action at a distance" -- universal gravitation -- Kepler's and Galileo's results were derivable.\n\nHis invention of the calculus, described opaquely in the Principia Mathematica, was for use as a tool to support his work on gravitation.\n\nNewton was no slouch as an experimentalist -- sometimes.  He performed top quality leading-edge experiments with optics, backing up his results with theoretical insights.  He also devoted considerable time and energy to the pseudoscience of alchemy -- turning base metals into gold -- with lesser success.\n\nBut it was his theoretical work that established his lasting reputation.5	what is kapil dev's highest ODI score? clue its between 174 and 178 175 not out off 72 balls against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells in 1983 World Cup.8	I need to get my mom off my back!? I am a 39 yr old mom to 3 girls.  My hubby and I have had financial problems in the past due to lack of funds.  We never spent wildly and we always paid our bills.  There was just nothing left over.  My dh is self-employed in construction and every winter, my mom goes nuts calling everyday asking if he is working.  A year and half ago, we started a new business and more than doubled our income.  We've paid off everything but our house and have a large savings account but she still calls almost everyday.  Now we are buying a piece of land to build our dream house.  She is so worried that we are going to "get in over our heads".  Every time that I talk to her she mentions something about it.  It's all so negative.  I just want her to be happy for us and to trust us. After all, we aren't a couple of immature kids.  We are almost 40 yrs old.  I don't know what to day that will calm her and keep her off my back without offending. Even if you're 140 years old you'll always be your mothers child and she will never stop worrying about you. She's probably so worried because she just wants you to be happy and as much as you guarantee her that you will, she won't believe it until she can actually see it. She just wants her girl to be happy and have a good, secure life. Some mothers are more worried and stressful than others (that's the case with your mom) but some don't show their worries as much as others and try to have faith in their children. This, of course, doesn't mean that your mom doesn't have faith and trust in you but it means that she's such a great mom and as much as she might bother you at times I will guarantee that you couldn't live without her for a second. Don't be too hard on her and try understanding her by imagining how you'd feel about you daughters and their married lives maybe that way you can sort things out.\nI hope I've helped a bit, Good luck! :)9	Why do judges use a gavel in court?

I've been studying vocab words, but it is so tedious and they aren't sticking in my head! When taking your test, double check your answers as you go, unless you begin to see this will not allow you to finish. This will probably save you time, instead of having to reread everything, and will also keep you aware of how you are progressing time wise. Also check the instructions to see if their are actual deductions for wrong answers-if you run out of time and randomly answer the last ones it might statistically detract from your score.

The solar wind is a continuous stream of ions (electrically charged particles) that are given off by the sun. Since the particles are emitted from the Sun as the Sun rotates, the solar wind blows in a pinwheel pattern through the solar system. It takes the solar wind about 5 days to reach Earth; it has a velocity of about 500 miles/hour (800 km/sec). The solar wind travels along vibrating magnetic waves which are propagated by the Sun5	Who will win game one of the NBA finals?  I give it dallas8	attic cat where are u from?

It sounds like he might still be hung up on his ex, but that isn't necessarily a death sentence for your relationship.  It is a cause for concern, however.  You should talk to him about it, tell him it concerns you because you wonder if he's still in love with her.  Approach the matter cautiously and without being judgmental, as it's a sensitive topic.

We know that the moon moves around the Earth. And that the Earth moves around the sun. And that stars are pretty stationary. So why doesn't seem that stars rise and set like the sun? Stars do move, as well as rise and set along the horizon just as the sun and moon do.\n\nStars, just like objects in out solar system, orbit the center of their galaxies.  However, most stars are just too far away to tell any discernible movement from day to day.\n\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis during the course of the night, stars will appear to rise and set on the horizon.  If you have a camera with the capability of a very long exposure, you take a picture of the sky over the course of a few hours.  When the picture is developed, you wont see just points of light, but rather streaks across the sky as the stars moved every so slightly.\nAlso, as the Earth revolves around the run throughout the year, certain stars become visible and others not based on out position in the solar system.  Some constellations can only be seen during the summer/winter since the Earth is located on the opposite side of the sun during those times.8	I like a guy in my Office,he is the person im looking for, but i m not that good looking,& fat,will i get him?  if your not attractive on the outside, be attractive on the inside.  he might notice you then.  if your serious about this and he's not noticing you try getting in shape.  also you might want to get to know him as a friend.

She expressed some interest in maybe having him do some work for her.  Mind you, she is a gay woman who is extremely liberal.  The first question she asked me was:  "What is his ethnicity?"  When I told her, she lost interest.  Who is the racist here? Interesting question. Republicans, in principle cherish small government and the freedom to expand economic activity.They will respect the citizen who is contributing to the economy, no matter what race he or she belongs to.\nDemocrats cherish big government and the idea of creating and maintaing a population dependent on the government.\nIn different ways, both Republicans and Democrats can be seen as racists.\nThere is another group much more dangerous than racists; the liberals. They discriminate against their own country9	why should smoking be legalized in public places?  Smoking in legal OUTDOOR places should be fine.  Making smoking illegal only pisses off smokers.

Like in a rifle, the groves or rifles inside the barrel give more energy to the bullet in comparison to a plain barrel gun with the same length of barrel. Can a helical shaped penstock give the discharge more energy? Can someone help..? and carry simulation modelling on this idea? ..mmmm.... NOT really correct!!! you know! Energy of water does not depend on the way that water flows, just about loss!\nDischarge of Water in WC is not main reason! in Air plane you can not have enough water flow. It works by pressure.\nAs you know in Bernoulli's Equation we have :\n\nE=z+(p/Gamma)+(v^2/2g)\n\nkinetic Energy just depends on Velocity. Well... let me back to your question...\nin a Hydropower design the main thing is having more energy and less Loss, during generating Electricity. Well... with the main key which I told you, is it really logical that you have a spiral flow?!! in spiral flow you have a lot of loss and also you have some important hit on penstock during swirling flow. If I were you, I designed a really simple and usual penstock. It works better. For comparing of them, you can calculate the value of loss in both alternative and then compare them.\nAnd about simulation model. let me leave you a piece of advice... mmm... Do not use model in this area!! try to see a physical model or built one of them (if your project is really important) because of this reason I told you that use a simple pattern for penstock.\n\nBe Success!!!0	sofonda silicone costume, Where can I get one or how do I make one?

The Happy Birthday Song!2	Need to lose 200 lbs by August? I am severely obese, weighing 420 lbs, and have weighed this much for about 5 years. I would like to impress/surprise my fiance', who has accepted me exactly as I am and who has been there for me in every way, with losing down to 190 lbs by our two year anniversary in late August. Seeing as I have been overweight for so long, my metabolism is very slow, if non-existant. \n\nI have cut out sodas and drink nothing but water all day, plus allowing myself artificially sweetened tea at meals.\n\nI need to lose about 1 pound every two days in order to reach my goal. I am looking for any advice anyone may have for me, that does not include spending alot of money. I can exercise, alebit carefully due to knee problems, and swim frequently (2 hours every day), but cannot afford any expensive pills. I do take multi-vitamins, but that is it. \n\nI would appreciate suggestions on how to lose this weight as quickly as possible without starving myself or breaking the bank! Thank you very much!\n\nCarey Carey, I'm sorry but the weight loss goal you are pursuing is nor realistic or safe.  And I would not even consider losing that kind of weight in that short a time period without medical guidance.\n\nEven at your level of obesity, the most amount of weight you should consider losing on any given week should not exceed 3-5 pounds.  This would not even get you half way to your goal, but at least you would have a much better chance of permanent weight loss.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to seek the advice and guidence of a naturopathic doctor who can help guide you in the right direction for safe and permanent weight loss through diet, supplementation and even exercise.\n\nIn the meantime here are some helpful tips for you to review:\n\nLose Weight Safely:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/losesafely.html\n\nHealthy Eating\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/healthyeating.html\n\nWeight Management Issues\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/management.html9	what's the best way to apply for green card?  go to the IRS at 5 in the morning, wait in a long line and apply for one(that's what i did)5	Do any of you twirl baton as a sport ?

I think dance requires such endurance to really do it for more than a couple minutes, the cardio of benefits would translate well to dance.  Does anyone else think there's a parallel?

Politicians act very much like commissioned salespeople I think.  They keep selling stuff we don't need.  Remember that many things ARE helped by centralization.  I, for one, believe that the entire world should be under the control of one government that imposes anti-murder laws, anti-theft laws, anti-rape laws, and anti-pollution laws, and possibly others.  Centralization improves standardization.  (crucial with the pollution issue)  Some projects cannot be attempted on the scale of the States, but can be accomplished by the central government.  NASA is a good example of this.  The armed forces, the intelligence agencies.  Since these are such a large part of what "the government" is, the government tends towards centralization.1	refreezing of water can changea rock by-fracturing it,eroding the surface,shattering it,change its composition  Figuring out some of these questions is like doing a puzzle....\n\nOkay, I get it. This is multiple choice. The best answer is:\nFRACTURING IT or SHATTERING IT\n\nWater will cleave the rock by expanding within it as it freezes. Freezing by itself will not erode the surface (this is meant to be a chemical process) except by fracturing. It might shatter from freezing. Same process of expansion of water when freezing. Changing it's composition? No this is a chemical process, not physical erosion.  Got it?2	What is the true color of our Blood?  In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is a bright red in color. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However, due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin, veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that before venous blood is exposed to air it is blue.8	Will my teacher get horny if i stare at his bulge during  the whole class? how else he could get horny?????

I need to know just a little bit more about his military inventions. In 1481, being discontented with his progress in Florence, he left for Milan.\nAgain came the thrust of war and again Leonardo's inventions poured from his fertile brain.\nIn a letter to the Duke of Milan he said he would build him "safe" unassailable covered wagons with artillery". Tank warfare to be "invented" in the 1914-1918 war had been invented. \nHe also invented for the Duke's use an explosive shell - shrapnel - poison gas and a protective gas mask, but once again was laughed at.\nAfter the war had receded Leonardo also invented a spinning machine, a look, a needle-sharpening machine and a metal rolling mill but his patron the Duke had no interest in machinery. He gave Leonardo a commission to paint a picture on one of the bare while walls of the refectory of the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. When it was finished it was the immortal "Last Supper".\nIn 1499 the French King Louis XII conquered Milan and Leonardo left for Venice. He arrived just as the Turks had defeated the Venetians at Lepanto and Turkish warships were threatening the city itself.\nThe council of Venice, having heard of Leonardo's ideas of military weapons consulted him about the defence of the city and almost overnight this ever amazing genius invented the submarine and the diving suit.\nThen, for some reason which has never been explained, Leonardo left Venice before either of his inventions could be used and returned to Florence.\nAgain came war, for Cesare Borgia, Prince of Romagna, decided to enlarge his principality by the simple expedient of absorbing his neighbouring states. To this end he invited Leonardo to become his military engineer, giving him the rank of a general.\nAfter two years, however, Leonardo returned to Florence which had become involved in war with Pisa.\nHe was again consulted and this time his mighty brain envisaged a scheme which was as fantastic as was devastating. \n\nThere's a whole lot more on the site3	Please tell me how can i judge a other person before making a friend?

However, all of a sudden she suspends me for a day because she feels like I got smart or "loud" with her. I talk to her that way all the time and she has never gotten upset about it. Now i'm wondering if I should apologize. First, you must realize that she has placed herself in a position were she is not only your boss but also your friend. She still has to maintain a certain level of authority over you and that requires her to reprimand you.  You should discuss with her your confusion as to her sudden change in tone when this has been a common scenerio between the two of you.  She may have just had a bad day and your comment was "the straw that broke the camels back", and she may apologize first! Other than that you need to discuss with her your limitations in this area. You need to understand that just because you are friends you can't use that to your advantage, nor be angry with her when she has to do her job.  You are the employee and she is your superior. As hard as that is to deal with, you must. Talk to her on nuetral ground (home, dinner, etc.) If you discuss this with her at work, she is still in the authority mode.

If having a monument of the 10 commandments in a courthouse is a violation of separation of church and state, how can witnesses being forced to put their hand ON A BIBLE, which is more of a religious artifact that just the 10 commandments, and swear to tell the truth? If people were forced to swear on the Koran, boy would the christians mobilize in force against that one. They don't do that. It's a hollywood thing. I've been to court many times (to observe, not as a witness or anything) and I've never seen them do that. They only ask you to raise your right hand and say "I swear the statement I am about to give is the truth." Or something similar.

I am in the Silicon Valley, South Bay. You will probably need more than one professional to help you with this, depending on the severity of your child's problem. My daughter's problem was quite severe, and we found that we needed both a psychologist for therapy, and a medical specialist who could prescribe meds (because most psychologists cannot). We had recommendations from other physicians, as well as from friends who had also been through it. Even the Yellow Pages may have listings that mention an expertise with ADD or ADHD. You might also check with your insurance company, or even the counselor at your child's school. Whoever you choose, it's important to have someone your teen feels comfortable with, and who has plenty of experience in this area.  You probably already know this, but if not, or for someone else reading this, it's important to realize just how serious this disorder can be. Lack of attention span is just one small part of it, and ADHD can have a tremendous impact on the life of your teen, and that of your entire family. I hope you find someone who can give you the help you need.8	is it possible to like a girl to much?  its nice to show her she means a lot to you,but also give her space..she is a person in her own rite and not just your property..you get too full on she will probably run!!!!!!2	Does anybosy know what these Bars are called that go in the back of ur mouth?

Want to know the composition of the medium required.\nWould like to know if any special conditions to be taken care off. Clostridium shows optimimum growth when plated on blood agar at human body temperatures. When the environment becomes stressed, however, the bacteria produce spores that tolerate the extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot.\n\nClostrium species also form spores which survive boiling water, but the Closterium species can not form spores in the presence of oxygen. Most clostridia are aerotolerant (they survive exposure to air), but most species of Clostridium do not resume growth if oxygen is present.\n\nMinimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins were determined in chemically defined medium for five strains of Clostridium difficile. Cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, tryptophan and valine were essential amino acids for growth of C. difficile. Arginine, glycine, histidine, methionine and threonine enhanced growth. Biotin, pantothenate and pyridoxine were essential vitamins. A defined medium containing the minimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins produced a rapid and heavy growth which was comparable to that in modified brain heart infusion, a complex medium. Adenine was able to substitute for glycine and threonine, suggesting that the two amino acids may be utilized as precursors of purine nucleotides. The defined medium developed here will assist physiological and biochemical studies on C. difficile.7	why does everyone always ask about dating? can't any one get creative?  I can!!

"The best and shortest road towards knowledge of truth [is] Nature."  \n\n2. "The kingdom of heaven is within you; and whosoever shall know himself shall find it."\n\n3. "Man, know thyself ... and thou shalt know the gods."\n\nDo you agree or disagree with these and why? 1.  I think this is mostly true because you have to understand the way things are before discovering her things will be.  And I also believe that the universe is governed according to natural law. But I also think that man exalts himself from the animals by his ability to act against his nature, to trust his intellect instead of his base desires and use foresight to predict the future.  Without this ability, we could never create laws and governments which are the key to modern civilization.\n\n2.  I've read that Buddhists believe that nirvana, their concept closest to heaven, is an internal state of extreme peace, not a place that we go after we die.  If you believe that, then this should be true to you.  While I declare no faith, I do believe that the first key to happiness is understanding your own desires.\n\n3.  With the infinite multiplicity of religious and spiritual beliefs, both culturally and individually, I can only conclude that God(s) are the product of imagination.  Many believe, however fallaciously, in a personal God, so I guess the responsibility for determining what is spiritually real lies within the man.\n\nInteresting proverbs.  Great food for thought.6	In hexadecimal arithmetic, adding 8F and 80FF makes a sum of    (a)- FF8E    (  B)FF8F (C) - 816F  (D) -  818E  (D) - 818E\n\nYou can use your Windows calculator to figure this out.\nStart up the calculator.

It would be hopeless to try to name every single one of the galaxies. There are about 50 billion of them. Instead scientist give them a catalogue name like NGC 1566 (New General Catalogue no. 1566 aka the Seyfert galaxy). Some galaxies were thought to have been nebulae or the remnants of stars. Charles Messier came up with a catalogue to organize them. Some, like M87, were not nebulae but galaxies and globular clusters. M87 is a gigantic elliptical galaxy that has a supermassive black hole, some 3 billion times more massive than the sun, in it´s center. So before M87 was discovered to be a galaxy it actually had a name.

I dont believe that the video represents the illegal immigrant population in the US, but I do think that the people SPEAKING on the video are supremicists and are spreading hate, which I do not approve of.

I would love to perhaps work in a nursing home but I have no degree in nursing. Are there certificates I could pursue? What does it take to become a nurse'a aide? Definitely!  In fact I'm guessing that most of the staff in nursing homes consists of nurse aides.  I am one myself but I work in assisted living.\n\nTo work in a nursing home (also called skilled care) you have to be a Certified Nursing Assistant.  Do some research and find out where in your area there are classes available for this.  After completing class work, you will probably have a "practical" experience which means clincial training in a nursing facility.  After doing this, you take a state test to becoming certified.

(x-3a)(x-2a)=0 (don't forget to do the whole equation), so x=3a OR x=2a. This gives x in terms of a. If you want a in terms of x, get a=x/3 OR a=x/2.2	Is there a difference between a Dietitian and a Nutritionist?  Dietitians are licensed, The term "nutritionist" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. See below for more detail. \n\n"Dietitians" (the preferred spelling in the United States) make up the majority of nutrition counselors who see patients in hospitals, clinics or other medical settings. In order to become a "Registered Dietitian" (R.D.), a person is usually licensed by a state government after passing the Registration Examination for Dietitians. In order to qualify to take this examination, an aspiring dietitian needs to complete four years of college, including required coursework in food science, food safety, chemistry, biology, anatomy and several other course areas that are specified by the Commission on the Accreditation for Dietetics Education. They also need to complete 900 hours of apprentice work in a clinical setting. This clinical work can be built into a specially designed undergraduate program or can be completed separately, as an internship program in dietetics. With somewhat less training, a person can qualify for the title, "Dietetic Technician, Registered" (DTR).\n\nThe term "nutritionist" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. Many dietitians casually call themselves "nutritionists," because they counsel people about nutrition. Some people use the term "nutritionist" to describe people who are educated in the field of dietetics or nutrition, but are not licensed to provide care to medical patients. There are many people who design food plans for communities or cafeterias who are not licensed as providers, but who provide an invaluable service by highlighting healthy eating practices in our communities.\n\nThank you for the question I learned something too.2	I have pain when i swallow and right at the top of my chest. like someone is pressing the top of my chest.?

You probably have more confidence now and people are drawn to that in a person( not cocky just sure of yourself). And the pressure is off them to be popular and around other popular people. They are more mature as you are and can pick friends that has traits that they really like instead of what their other friends like.6	is it good to buy second house riyth now?  no, rising interest rates7	did elvis presely ever serve at west point military academy in the army band while he was in the army?  when?  no , sir , he did not . as a matter of fact he never recorded any songs while in the military either. 1958-1960. also , he was an enlisted man . no west point.7	Clean My House? A woman was sitting at a bar enjoying an after-work cocktail with her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely sexy, young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could not take her eyes away from him. \nThe young man noticed her overly attentive stare and walked directly toward them. Before she could offer her apologies for being so rude as to stare, the young man whispered to her, "I'll do anything, absolutely anything, that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $100, on one condition." \nFlabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. \nThe young man replied, "You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words." \nThe woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from her purse, and slowly counted out five $20 bills, which she gladly pressed into the young man's hand. \nShe looked deeply into his eyes and slowly and meaningfully said, "Clean my house." another top quality joke from one of yahoos best tellers0	who was finn the fair?

It seems to be a blatant disregard for Gods commandment, Do not worship false idols.  I know having grown up with Catholic relatives that they pray to the idols of Mary and other Saints.  Praying to anything is a form of worship. How do they justify this as not breaking a commandment? If there is any "blatant disregard" here, it's for the Truth.\n\n6bits, please familiarize yourself with "Sacramentals".\n\nImages and Statues\nDeut. 4:15 - from this verse, Protestants say that since we saw "no form" of the Lord, we should not make graven images of Him.\n\nDeut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly "in the form of any figure." \n\nDeut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times. \n\nExodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc). \n\nDeut. 5:8 - God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. \n\nExodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God. \n\nNum. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural. \n\nI Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship. \n\n2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images. \n\n1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship. \n\n2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold. \n\nEzek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches. \n\nCol. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" (Greek "eikon") of the invisible God. \n\nRelics\nMark 15:43; John 19:38 - Joseph of Arimathea sought Christ's dead body instead of leaving it with the Romans. Joseph gave veneration to our Lord's body.\n\nMark 16:1; Luke 24:1 - the women came to further anoint Christ's body even though it had been sealed in the tomb. \n\nJohn 19:39 - Nicodemus donated over one hundred pounds of spices to wrap in Jesus' grave clothes. This is also veneration of our Lord's body. \n\nMatt. 9:21; Mark 5:28 - the woman with the hemorrhage just sought the hem of Christ's cloak and was cured. This shows that God uses physical things to effect the supernatural. \n\nActs 19:11-12 - Paul's handkerchiefs healed the sick and those with unclean spirits. This is another example of physical things effecting physical and spiritual cures. \n\nActs 5:15 - Peter's shadow healed the sick. This proves that relics of the saints have supernatural healing power, and this belief has been a part of Catholic tradition for 2,000 years. \n\nRev. 6:9 - the souls of the martyrs are seen beneath the heavenly altar. Their bones are often placed beneath altars in Catholic churches around the world. \n\n2 Kings 13:21 - Elisha's bones bring a man back to life. The saints' bones are often kept beneath the altars of Catholic churches and have brought about supernatural cures throughout the Christian2	in the 5o's and 60's parents gave their kids crazy crystal laxitave...I'm looking for a source of it.

Beware of Canola Oil, Canola Oil is an Industrial Oil, Not Fit For Human Consumption.\n\nBefore you read the following article\nhttp://www.karinya.com/canola.htm\n\nhere is a summary of a few facts regarding Canola Oil:\n# It is genetically engineered rapeseed.\n# Canada paid the FDA the sum of $50 million to have rape seed registered and recognized as "safe". (Source: Young Again and others)\n# Rapeseed is a lubricating oil used by small industry. It has never been meant for human consumption.\n# It is derived from the mustard family and is considered a toxic and poisonous weed, which when processed, becomes rancid very quickly.\n# It has been shown to cause lung cancer (Wall Street Journal: 6/7/95)\n# It is very inexpensive to grow and harvest. Insects won't eat it.\n# Some typical and possible side effects include loss of vision, disruption of the central nervous system, respiratory illness, anemia, constipation, increased incidence of heart disease and cancer, low birth weights in infants and irritability.\n# Generally rapeseed has a cumulative effect, taking almost 10 years before symptoms begin to manifest. It has a tendency to inhibit proper metabolism of foods and prohibits normal enzyme function. Canola is a Trans Fatty Acid, which has shown to have a direct link to cancer. These Trans Fatty acids are labeled as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid all of them!\n# According to John Thomas' book, Young Again, 12 years ago in England and Europe, rape seed was fed to cows, pigs and sheep who later went blind and began attacking people. There were no further attacks after the rape seed was eliminated from their diet.1	Which direction does the sun rise from? Which direction does the sun rise from?

Ear buds that are supplied with mp3 players cause more ear damage than cup headphones. Or at least they sure hurt your ears more.\n4.

The card said "Turn on the test equipment", which had a metal ON/OFF switch that turned out to be broken, causing 110 volts to shoot through me when I turned it on.  I bounced off the wall behind me and, somewhat dazed, looked at the card again to see if that was one of the requirements.

Why are YOU always ON YOUR cellphones!? lol, I just had to ask! ^_^ Because you guys are always calling us!1	how can we increase our brain power and memmory? What is our brain memmory?\nHow can we boost it up?\n&\nThe capacity of our brain. Lately you find that you have a problem remembering, such things as a person’s name and the date that events are held on. You would like to improve your memory, but you don’t know where to begin to accomplish a greater memory. \n\n\nDifferent parts of the brain, handle different types of remembering tasks, such as recalling a person’s phone number versus remembering a person’s car. \n\nPeople tend to remember things differently through the use of dreferential senses, which means seeing something versuses hearing it. \n\nThis approach acknowledges, that specific memory stategies, are appropriate for different memory tasks. Memory strategies must be talented, to meet the individual’s memory needs. \n\nThis approach also recognizes that memory can be affected by many factors, including cognitive, which involves knowledge about memory strategies and some non-cognitive, which deals with such \n\nthings as overall fitness, mood and health. \n\n\nThere’s a method of memory called the Holistic view of memory. This approach is based on the concept of an individual’s memory readiness. \n\n\nScientists and health-care say that memory readiness can be improved, with a person’s attitude physical condition, their \n\nemotional state, conversational skills and the use of physical memory aids. These aids can be used in improving practical memory performance. \n\n\nTests have shown that monentary memory can vary at particular times, which can happen during the course of the day, course of the week or month. \n\n\nPeople tend to believe that their memory skills, are poorer than they really are. \n\n\nImproving your memory can be done at anytime. It doesn’t matter if your young, old, brilliant or average. Your memory can still be improved to remember better. \n\n\nThere’s no magic pill that can be taken to improve ones memory. To improve one’s memory, a person has to access the state of various memory abilities and then this adds to a person’s memory \n\nskills one at a time. \n\n\nSometimes if a person is stressed or has a cold their memory can be affected. Some nutritionists believe that vitamins help improve memory. \n\n\nThere are various memory techniques, that a person can do to improve their memory. \n\n\nOne method is the mnemonics method. This method is used for remembering information, that’s otherwise quite difficult to recall. The principle of mnemonics, is to use as many of the \n\nbest functions of the human brain, as possible to code information into the memory. The mnemonics method uses the human brain that’s used to code and interpret complex stimuli-images, colour, structure, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, emotion and languages. The brain uses these to make sophisticated interpretations, of the environment. These features are what the \n\nhuman memory is made of. \n\n\nInformation presented to the brain to be remembered,is all from one source, which is normally words on a page. Language or words \n\non a page reflects, are of the most important aspect of the human evolution. Mnemonics seeks to use all of these resources, by coding the language and the numbers in sophisticated striking \n\nimages, which flow into stronger images then are actually coded. Both information and structure of the information which is, to be recalled later. This method is simple and easy to understand. Remembering names is important, but such things as remembering, a pack of cards is just an amusing sideline. \n\n\nWhen remembering a person’s name, you can improve memory by using face association. With this technique, when you are introduced to a person examine the person’s face. Find an unusual ffeature of the person’s face. Create an association with the person’s face and the name will be in your memory. Also use repetition \n\nwhen being introduced, ask for the name to be repeated, use the name yourself, as much as possible. The more you hear the person’s name, the more the name will sink in your memory. \n\n\nW3	what is the main reason for collage student to dress up?

For example, they have no oil or valuable minerals. They have way too many people in a very concentrated spot. Fortunately, the internet came along and is beginning to harvest their greatest resource - the intelligence of their people. India has simply had very little infastructure and never had the capital it needs to build it. Ironically, this lack of infstrutcure may now be an advantage because they can build everythiing from the ground up while learning from the mistakes of others. I think that in the end, India will be the new super power. But, in the meantime, know that it's one thing to turn around the economy of 250 million people who have plenty of resources... it's another to turn around the economy of 1.3 billion with no natural resources.7	The group Pretty Ricky, when is their birthday?  http://www.groups.msn.com/PrettyRickyFanClub\n\ntry this site8	my ex is going out with someone else who doesnt love her.

I am going to turn 18 and someone told me to do something that i will remember my eighteenth birthday so should i get a tattoo? do they hurt? what should i get? any ideas in mind? I need someone;s idea or if a tattoo isnt it then what should i do ? tattoos only hurt depending on where you get them, my recommendation to you is to get a small tattoo that can be easily consealed by clothing or is concealed by clothing if you are wearing a shirt and shorts. the reason being is that if at some point down the road you absolutely hate your tattoo then you can at least keep it covered, it wont affect your ablity to get a job (because it is covered) and if you dont use colors other than black and blue it can be removed easier. and as far as what to get, get something that says something about you, not something you might change your mind on later in life. for example my gf got a tattoo of autumn leaves on her ankle because her middle name is autumn, which isnt likely to change. so dont be getting tattoos of what is cool now, get something that is relatively timeless6	i know that e85 is big how can i get into that market. is there a company that focus on this like selling it.? i want a comapny that is cheap to invest in i only have $1,000.

Your question is a bit vague. The study of limits is formalized by the epsilon-delta definition that one learns in introductory calculus, but limits aren't really found that way. Instead, one presupposes a limit using other methods and then proves that limit (or disproves it as may be the case) using the definition. Thus, a possible problem in learning limits may be inexperience with the behavior of functions and series/sequences, but that is easily overcome.\nIf, on the other hand, you're referring to problems that may occur when studying the limit of a function at a point, the largest problem is that limits at the point taken along different directions are not the same, and thus we say the limit of the function at that point does not exist. \nAnother problem is that the limit may exist at the point, but the value of the function at that point is not the same as the limit of the function at that point. When this occurs, we say that the function is not continuous at the point in question.\nThe only other problem is that the limit of the function may not exist due to the function diverging at that point (as one approaches the point from each direction, the value of the function increases or decreases without bound).5	Does anyone have St Kilda Wallpapers if so can they send them to me please?

About how many slides would a 2 hour presentation need. I was told to make a 2 hour presentation and I would like to know about how many slides that would take me. Thanks. It depends on how long you will spend on each slide. If you talk for 10 minutes on each, that's 12 slides. If you have them transitioning every 10 seconds, that's 720 slides.\n\nEDIT: Prepare a 2 hr presentation on the surgical procedure with out making any slides.

If you were in relationship with a guy for 6 years, he is a few years older and you both share a child and you love him very much but the problem is he is so unromantic. You give him hints but he just don't catch on. He does no romantic thing for you not even on specail occassions and he does not like to go out, this just let you feel unattractive, but you love this guy world without end but you are longing for some real romance. As a guy, I have experience in this.  When women talk, they are talking in a different language.  In my experience, women beat around the bush.  I don't know what kind of hints you are dropping but you need to be up front, direct. Give him some hints of what would be nice.  He may not realize what you are hinting to.  I know I never had a clue when I was being hinted to.  It took me several years.  Go to the book store and get Men are from Mars and Woman are from Venus.  It says allot.  I think I is a great book.  I am sure that there are several books that give you a little more insight on the male mind but that is a good start.  DON"T GIVE UP ON HIM.  Both of you need to sit down and discuss things keeping an open mind and promising that no matter what is said, you won't take offense to it.  It needs to be a conversation that will bring the two of you closer, not a conversation that will drive a stake into either of your hearts.  It is easy to think someone is picking up on your hints.....but sometimes the hints go unnoticed.  Good luck and don't give up. Have a honest conversation.  I have always said one thing to women I have tried to date.  "Tell me the good truth, tell me the bad truth, just tell me the truth".  I know I am a big boy and I would rather be hurt a little now than a lot later.  By the way, I am 38, in case you were wondering.   Mike6	how was ur day today?

Are you glad or regret taking it? There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.4	why can I no longer run DOS programs under Windows XP?

People tend to learn best when they are using things that are more familar to them.  Language is so intimately tied to culture, identity, our history etc.  It allows us to fully express ourselves.  When we lose that ability, we lose so much more.  I believe it is important to maintain a native language.  I also believe in our ability to learn other languages. In doing so, we open up so many other worlds too.  To me, it's not a choice of "one or the other". . .it's the choice to learn more than what I already know, and to nuture what I already have.2	Brown Light Spotting since period ended for about 5 days now.? I have always been regular and never ever had any spotting once my period ended. This past period I began birth control pills but stopped after 1 week due to side effects. After my period ended I have been spotting, it is now 5 days. Its light, no scent, and brownish. This is really worrying me and I am going to call my GYN come monday but I would like any advice. Also my fiance and I have unprotected sex, he pulls out, for almost 2 yrs now and we both have gotten tested for all std's and both of us came back clean, and my pap came back within the normal range and we are exclusive and have not cheated on each other. Any suggestions or help will be greatful especially since I probably won't be able to get a GYN appt. for 2 weeks or more that is always the case.  Thank You This is kind of funny but I answered the same question for my female friend less then two days ago because she had the same issue, same problem! I researched it for her as a medic that likes to study gyn and here's your answer: The surge of hormones in your body causes your endometrium (lining of the uterus) to become extremely thick and then fissure and crack (so to speak) at your fourth week and then to fold and flush out of your body(menses). When you take the pill it enforces a state of pregnancy on the body and causes your endometrium to thicken and stay thickened so that you cannot become pregnant because your body already thinks that it is. So when your on it for three days or more esp. right after your period your endometrium starts to thicken again rapidly due to the surge of hormones the pill is providing, but then you suddenly come off and your body is like what the hec!?! I need to flush my lining again but it's not thick enough for a complete mense so it just releases the little that it's built up by infrequent spotting till the lining goes back to ex nhilo, or the beginning of a fresh cycle. So it's really nothing to worry about at all unless you starting cramping terribly and have spotting into the two week range. Then you should see your gyno. I hope I covered everything if I missed something post an additional detail and I'll do my best to answer it.0	what job did u want most when u were little? apparently when i was 4, i was desperate to be a milk-lady!!

I am about to replace the starter of a 1988 chevy cavalier.  How can I tell if it is the solenoid or the starter? chevy starters have the solenoid built into the starter itself- located on the back of the bendix drive- replacing the whole starter is recommended - this will cure your issue. your starter if I remember right sits under the exhaust manifold in the front of the engine and gets extreme heat from the exhaust and will dry out the solenoid and bendix along with the rest of the starter.0	does anyone here still listen to Hendrix , Led Zep , Cream , Clapton  or Black Sabbath??? or am I just an extinct dinosaur that is going to die soon???.........they will play ZZ Top and SRV and Pink Floyd at my funeral whether my family likes it or not. what do I care then, I cant hear them gripe or moan about it. hey, I lived, I partied, I died.let the party go on without me...end of story I still love Hendrix, I will never get tired of the Band of Gypsies from New Years Eve 1969. Some of the most brilliant Hendrix guitar playing ever. ZZ Top always makes me smile although I don't listen that much anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have most of their older albums. Led Zeppelin was brilliant, I loved Zeppelin I, II, and IV the most. I need to break some out since you made me think of it. Pink Floyd did some things that I just loved, "Shine on You Crazy Diamond", "Dark Side of the Moon", "The Wall", great albums, genius. I was a Hendrix freak when I was younger, then I was exposed to the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia. So much of that music is so poignant and relevant to me and the way I experience life. I think it will be something in my life forever. In fact, I have had that same thought, about my funeral. I have a couple of Grateful Dead songs I want played. If you are familiar, I am going to have "Brokedown Palace" played. It almost makes me cry every time I hear it, a very beautiful piece. I also want to have "Sing Me Back Home" played too. I know it isn't a Dead original, but I just love to hear Jerry's voice on songs like that. I have decided to go back to school for a career change and I am there every day with a bunch of 18-19 year old kids. Most have no idea what any of that music sounds like. All they know is hip hop rap or death metal. I often ask myself if I too am a dinosaur. I'm right there with you.5	Has anybody ever heard of Derby County?  What are they?

I need a cure or at least to know that permanent dibilitating damage will not occur.The only symtom i have is numbness and that i can deal with . I have a lot of success with treating patients with carpal tunnel, but usually if I cannot help, the scar tissue accumulation is too advanced.  The patients usually have the surgery, and come back to me with success!  I would have the surgery if all other non-invasive methods have failed.  The truth is, when Carpal tunnel advances, "wallerian degeneration" occurs, where the nerve simply loses its ability to transmit signals.  The numbness you're experiencing is the first stage, then pain, followed by loss of muscle function.  Sorry to ramble on, but if left untreated, you WILL lose the use of the thumb and 3 1/2 fingers.

A particular engine has a power output of 5.00 kW and an efficiency of 20.0%. Assume the engine expels 6000 J of energy in each cycle. \n(a) Find the energy absorbed in each cycle.\n\nYour answer differs from the correct answer by 10% to 100%. kJ\n(b) Find the time required to complete each cycle.\n s A watt is a Joule/sec. So the engine output is 5 kJ/s. "Your answer differs from the correct answer by 10% to 100%." It would have been helpful to know what you put in to get this response.\n\na) "Expels" ... does that mean wasted energy or useful energy? I'll assume it's useful energy.

While moving it's parallel to the x axes (looks like a '-' that going up).\nA system S', which it's axes are parallel to those of S system, moves in a velocity V in x direction relatively to the S system. A viewr in S' system will find the pole moves while creating an angle with the x' axes (looks like '/').\nWhat is the explanation of this angle, and how can I calculate the angle, using V and u (and maybe C - the light velocity) - pay attention that all velocities can be close to the light velocity. From what I understood in your question is that you have two objects (two frames of references), S and S'.\n\nEach are side by side, the first object is moving at a constant velocity, u, along the +y axis.  Meanwhile, S' moves at a constant velocity, v, at some angle away away from the y axis in the +x direction such that S and S' stay parallel with eachother.\n\nDiagram:\n\nS------S'\nS----S'\nS---S'\nS--S'\nS-S'\nSS'\n\nYour question did not mention that either object was travelig anywhere near the speed of light, so we can use ordinary Newtonain relativity for this.\n\nIt is just common sense that since S' is moving at an angle away from S and yet stays parallel, it must be moving faster...but how much faster.\nWe know that the +y velocity is S (u) much eqaul the +y velocity of S' (v).  So we know that,\nv*cos(angle) = u\nor to rearrange,\ncos(angle) = u/v,\nso angle = cos^-1(u/v)5	any tennis coaching classes in surat? plz give me the address dont know.6	Why do they have brail at drive up ATM's??

Use l'hopitals rule to sokve the following\n\nlim        ((cos(x) - 1) / x^2)\nx->0 Read my other answer for the explanation for this one. :-)\n\nYou have zero on top and zero on bottom, so you can certainly go ahead and use L'hopitals.\n\nDerivative of top and bottom.\n\nCos(x) -1 becomes  (-sinx)\nand x^2 becomes 2x.\n\nNow you have -sinx / 2x which you need to evaluate for x->0. On top you have sin(0) which is zero, and on bottom 2(0) is zero. You have 0/0 again, so L'hopital again.\n\n-Sin x becomes -Cos x\n2x becomes 2.\n\nNow you get -Cosx / 2, evaluated for zero that's -1/2.\n\nHope that helped,\nUMRmathmajor9	what do i need to send an army guy in iraq?

Try this for a start, the go on to a well balanced diet and regular exercise.  This does work.......\n\nBASIC  FAT  BURNING  SOUP\n\n6 large green onions                                    2 green peppers                             \n1 or 2 cans of tomatoes [crushed]              1/2 bunch of celery                                 \n1 large head of cabbage                                1 pkg. Lipton onion soup\n4 cups of water\n\nSeason with 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp. curry, 1 Tbsp. parsley, if desired or bouillon or hot sauce. Cut vegetables in small to medium pieces and cover with water. Boil fast for ten minutes.  Reduce to simmer and continue cooking until vegetables are tender.  This soup can be eaten anytime you are hungry.  Eat as much as you want, whenever you want.  This soup will not add calories.  The more you eat the more you will lose.  Fill a thermos in the morning if you will be away during the day.  If eaten for indefinite periods you would suffer malnutrition.\n=============================================================\n\nDAY ONE:  All fruits except bananas.  Cantaloupe and watermelon are lower in calories than most fruits.  Eat only the soup and fruits.  For drinks; unsweetened tea, cranberry juice, or water.\n\nDAY TWO:  All vegetables.  Eat until you are stuffed with all the fresh, raw, or canned vegetables.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans, peas, and corn. Eat along with the soup.  At dinner time on this day, reward yourself with a big baked potato and butter.  Do not eat any fruits.\n\nDAY THREE:  Eat all the soup, fruits, and vegetables you want.  Do not have a baked potato.  If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will have lost 5 to 7 pounds.\n\nDAY FOUR:  Bananas and skim milk. Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many glasses of water as you can on this day along with the soup.  Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on this particular day your body will need the potassium and \nthe carbohydrates, proteins and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.\n\nDAY FIVE:  Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 to 20 ounces of beef and a can of tomatoes or as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water\nthis day to wash away the acid in your body.  Eat the soup at least once this day.\n\nDAY SIX:  Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of the beef and vegetables this day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with the green leafy vegetables, but no baked potato.  be sure and eat the soup.\n\nDAY SEVEN:  Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables. Again, stuff yourself.  Be sure to have the soup at least once today.\n\nAt the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on the above diet, you will have lost 10 to 17 pounds.  If  you have lost more than 17 pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming again from day one.\n \nThis seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being as never before.\n\nAfter only seven days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least 10 and possibly 17 pounds, having an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan as long as you wish and feel the difference.\n\nThis diet is fast, fat-burning, and the secret is that you will burn more calories than you take in. It will flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lend itself to drinking any alcoholic beveragesat any time because of the removal of fat build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any intake of alcohol.\n\nBecause everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when you began, if you did not cheat.  After\nbeing on this diet for several9	Has President Bush made any responses. . .? to the 2006 election response?

Hello!!! how can i convert log cfu/ml to g/ml (in microbiology) Please, i really need it. logcfu refers to the number of colony forming units of a bacteria, to work out the g/ml you need to know the weight of the bacteria. As its the g/ml I guess you're looking at wet weight. The average weight of a bacteria is 9.5E-13 g [1]. Then you have to consider the size of the colony, it is normally assumed (for simplicity) that the bacteria have been diluted, so that they could be counted, to the extent that 1 bacteria = 1 cfu. Essentially this means that cfu*9.5E-13 = g/ml\n\nHope this helps1	Does Seroquel show positive on a drug test? If so which drug does It show up as?

The increase represents a growth of 25% for girls and 40% for boys.  How many girls were in the math club last year? Let g = # of girls in the math club last year\n(which is what we're looking for)\nand b = # of boys in the math club last year\n\ng + b = 75, or b = 75 - g\n1.25g + 1.4b = 99\n\nTherefore,\n1.25g + 1.4(75 - g) = 99\n1.25g + 105 - 1.4g = 99\n105 - 0.15g = 99\n-0.15g = -6\ng = 40  (which means b = 35)\n\nChecking my work:\nA growth of 25% for girls would mean the number of girls went from 40 to 1.25*40, which is 50.\nA growth of 40% for boys would mean the number of boys went from 35 to 1.4*35, which is 49.\nAnd 50 + 49 = 99.5	who will make it too the super bowl 41? the game is over, the bus made his last stop. still what a sloppy came? lol!

His attorney didn't tell us that papers hadn't been signed, we thought bankruptcy was taken care of.  He has no spouse, children -only property was an old car. Now bank informs us of loan that needs to be paid.  Attorney says no bankruptcy was filed--he's keeping the fees.  Bank wants life insurance policy for loan.  Can they take life insurance to pay for loan?  What about other creditors?  We need to know--we had to pay all funeral expenses and would like to be able to be reimbursed for that from life insurance policy.\nThanks If the life insurance named a beneficiary, then the policy is a contract between the insured and the insurer and the bank is not allowed by law to intervene in that and therefore they are not entitled to the money.\n\nIf the money was left to an estate, then the bank could make a claim against the estate and get some money for the car loan that way.  Once the estate's bills are paid off, then the remaining money can be divided among the heirs.\n\nThe bank itself may have purchased its own policy on the car with themselves as beneficiary.  This is called BOLI or bank owned life insurance.  It is very common.\n\nJust the same the way the bank can't get the life insurance if they are not the beneficiary, you can't get 'reimbursed' for the funeral expenses if you are not named the beneficiary.\n\nOnly the named beneficiary can decide IF they want to pay the funeral expenses.  They are certainly not required to.4	i have a notebook,harddisk is 30gb,but now it appears only 20gb-one partition is hided,help me to recover it? i change my partition from fat32 into ntfs, but while changing i get a mistake that change into other, so it disappears, when i recover it, always getting information is recovering fail.could you show me the way to recover it, You dont mention what OS you are using.

They are located off the cost of North Africa.

The Canary islands are, in actuality, a desert.9	meaning of barriers?  Barriers is a set of purer-than-pure Berlin school electronica. The Nightcrawlers -- Peter Gulch, Tom Gulch, and David Lunt -- were known for this style of e-music. Unfortunately, their fan base can best be described as a cult following. Despite their purity and excellence, this trio never achieved anything close to the recognition that they deserved. All of their albums and cassettes are long out of print and only a small portion of their prodigious output has been remastered for CD reissue. This rare slice of history is essential electronica.

The only way to ease hangovers is drink a glass or two of water before you go bed after a night of drinking, and take two Tylenol. Alcohol pulls the water out of your system (basically dehydrates you), and it's the lack of water that gives you a hangover. If you put water back into your body before you go to bed you won't get a hangover. Since I found this out, I haven't had a hangover in four years.6	Do you like Green Day? cuz I do!

How did I get that? I was also told that my uterus is septate Ascites is defined as an excessive amount of fluid built up within the peritoneal cavity. Both the abdominal organs and the abdomen itself are lined with membranes called the peritoneum. Between these two linings is a space referred to as the peritoneal cavity. In pathological conditions that result in edema, or excessive fluid accumulation in bodily tissues, fluid can build up in the peritoneal cavity.  \nA septate uterus is a uterus with a dividing wall of tissue (septum) within the uterine cavity. It can be treated with surgery if the tissue is thick, but if the tissue is thin it usually poses no problem during pregnancy.\nAs for what caused your condition, ask your doctor.  He or she is the best source for your medical questions.  Ascites, in itself, is not a disease, but rather a symptom of several other pathological conditions.4	Can someone tell me how to get difference of Years between two dates? i hv a list and i hv to get age of employees as on 31.03.2006. how to get the difference? in excel --\n\nits simple 31/3/2006 minus birth date. both cells should be in birthdate format.0	do you believe in god?

The group adopted the name, deliberately misspelling the first part to prevent people from pronouncing it as "leed."1	What is the function of the testis?  testicles are components of both the reproductive system and the endocrine system  The respective functions of the testicles are:\n\nproducing sperm (spermatozoa) \nproducing male sex hormones, of which testosterone is the best-known2	What's the best sunscreen?  There's no one brand that's the best - but you do want one with a UVA-blocking ingredient as well as a UVB-blocker.  UVB ones are easy to come by - they're in every sunscreen - it's the UVA ones that are more difficult to find.\n\nLook at the ingredients list - there are only THREE tried-and-true UVA blockers (no matter what the label says).\n\nAvobenzone (aka Parsol 1789)\nTitanium dioxide\nZinc oxide\n\nAvobenzone is a chemical block - it absorbs the sun's rays and basically neutralizes the effect chemically.  The bad part about Avobenzone is that it does degenerate over a period of a few hours, so you need to reapply fairly frequently.\n\nTitanium dioxide and zinc oxide are physical blocks - they reflect the sun's rays, so they don't ever hit your skin.  Unfortunately, if you have darker skin and are using a product in which the particles of titanium/zinc have not been micronized properly, these products can leave a whitish cast on your skin.\n\nThe best thing to do to find a good-quality ZO or TD sunscreen is to check labels and expect to pay about $10-$12 for a tube.  It may seem expensive but isn't your skin worth it?\n\n[If you live in Canada or Europe there is a newer sunscreen ingredient available called Meroxyl - it's VERY effective at blocking UVA and UVB rays when blended with Avobenzone in a product - L'Oreal's Ombrelle line has this combination and it's great.  It's what I use, but it's not available in the U.S. - yet.]9	About this Iaraq torture prison scadal?  Was is REALLY low echelon enlisted folk doing it? It seems like they got their marching orders from higher up in the chain of command. Yes, it was enlisted personnel who did it. Not necessarily "lower echelon" enlisted (a Staff Sergeant is already serving time), but enlisted.\n\nI do not believe ANY commander would ORDER his people to do that. I have spent far too long in the military than to know better than that. But I certainly do believe their command knew about it and condoned it.8	My wife loves to beat my 2 yr. old son...what should I do!!!!!!!!?

( not in the middle.)?  Oh that's easy, I can help you with that. The logos on each side of the fifty years line represent both the spirit of New England and of the new Gillette stadium. That being our sea ferring bridge and lighthouses, both of which have made new england famous in part and are two architectural elements or components of the stadium. Go to a game and you'll see how this enblem personafies so much of the stadium. \n\nIn fact, the stadium is largely conjoined by the sea ferring bridge and lighthouse architecture and you can actually watch games from these monuments 200 feet up above the playing field. \n\nWith that said, let's go pats!

The Internet's dictionary.com website defines "police state" as: "A state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the people, especially by means of a secret police force." \n\nas General Tommy Franks recently suggested, that moment will come when yet another serious terrorist attack, provoked and instigated by our own meddling, interventionist, imperialistic government, occurs on our soil. All the necessary “laws” are now in place! Never mind that they are all completely unconstitutional! And never mind as well that the finishing touches of our unconstitutional “laws” have been finalized and put in place by a “limited government” Republican administration! America is now “legally” a police state!\n\nPersonaly, I think America is being destroyed by design.\nIt doesnt matter who gets elected as President, they are just a puppet, taking orders from somewhere else. To a certain degree you have fulfilled the qualifications of a Police State.  Habeus corpus waves bye bye.8	How do u find love? I have no boyfriend.(But i really want one) I don't.  I leave myself open to the possibility.  Searching doesn't seem to work and I get really discouraged. Then I become negative and things definitely don't happen.

You may be surprised by the results.7	Does Anyone Need Lyrics??? lyrics guys i can get them for you... no thanks..

My mom has mounting medical bills and can't pay but the hospital wants to sue him as well saying the prenup is only good for divorce, even though the prenup says their finances are seperate before and during the marriage.  Who is right? Or is this a collection scare tactic? Did he (your mother's spouse) sign anything at the hospital stating that he would be resposible for the medical bills?  If he did then a prenup can't help.  Honestly, prenup or not his credit can be at stake here if they own a home together.  A lien can be attached to the home and even if the lien is entirely in your mother's name, you father could still have to pay off the lien with interest and court costs and attorney's fees before selling or refinancing said home.  Its called a lien on real and personal property.  \n\nI would just make payment arrangements with the hospital and dutifully pay it.  If your mother is not in the position to do so, maybe her spouse will lend her the money and she can pay him monthly or add to the pernup that he gets something equitable in return, in the event of a divorce.\n\nOnce again, I REPEAT, if he did NOT sign ANYTHING at the hosipital then he is can NOT be held financilly responsible in most states.\n\nGood Luck and Take Care9	Are Navy servicemen allowed to combine mgib benefits with navy tuition assistance? The serviceman has been on active duty for 2 years and is eligble for mgib benefits. Being an x-navy man I know this one!  No.  MGIB is for when you get out of the Navy. While you're in, the Navy pays for everything but your books.  So there's no need to use the MGIB.\n\nBooks are expensive I know...but that's the rules.\n\nWhen you get out, its no fun either.  You have to pay for classes up front and then get reimbursed several weeks later...get a credit card now!9	Military Service? I was in Bootcamp training for Army reserve. I even didn't finish the training and was discharged as OTH after being an AWOL.\n\nMy question is when employers aks for Military serrvice .. what should be my answer...I am writing NO as i never finished the training and never posted to some base.Is it ok ?? or i have to write YES....I guess it shouldn't consider as Military service or veteran .\n\n.Please correct me if wrong. Technically, you've served in the military.  So, your honestly answer should be "Yes".\n\nHowever, it may impede your chances of employment.\n\nIf you apply of government jobs and you answer "no" and they find out otherwise, you can not only face losing your job, but also face criminal fines and/or jail time.  This goes the same if you apply for some government contractor's job.\n\nSome states and with some bigger companies (like Best Buy) can seek charges if you falsified any information on your official application.\n\nServing in the military and receiving an OTH discharge because of being AWOL is just as bad as going to jail or had charges with a crime.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you finished training or not.  You signed on the dotted line and said I swear/affirm.  The fact that your DD Form 214 or other documents state that you were discharged from military service, shows you had served.  Good thing for you, you didn't received a Dishonorable Discharge (this is worse), instead you got an Other Than Honorable.\n\nIt sucks but it would behoove you to be honest, because at least it will show them you have integrity.  Just be honest and upfront why you went AWOL and why the military was a mistake for you.9	how would i figure out the Grand Rapids Police Department schedule?  Well....have you tried just calling the Grand Rapids PD to ask them?

Advantages of Credit Cards \n\n\nThere is an implicit guarantee of satisfaction with purchases because the customer is able to stop payment on a credit card account for unsatisfactory services. A number of companies guarantee all purchases over the internet. \n\nFree purchase points and merchandise. This is becoming more and more prevalent as credit card companies boost the amount of incentives they provide customers to apply. The more you use your card, the more points towards future purchases you get. \n\nFree airfare mileage points. Credit cards credit you a small percentage of each purchase towards airfare through affiliated airlines. These are like frequent flier miles. Its quite a significant incentive to charge particularly large expenditures on credit cards. \n\nEstablishing credit history and keeping a good credit rating. There are a number of key transactions in modern life which require a good credit rating. Getting a loan or dealing with a mortgage company is one of these. All sorts of other accounts now also include an investigation of your credit rating by the service provider. Credit cards are a perfect way to maintain a good rating. \n\nRe-establish credit rating after bankruptcy or other financial mishap. Those with poor credit histories or those undergoing debt consolidation or credit repair initiatives often use credit cards to repair the damnge. Secured credit cards can be used in such cases where companies are reluctant to issue unsecured credit cards. \nAlso See: Differences Between Secured and Unsecured Credit Cards. \n\n\nOn the internet, credit cards give you the advantage of comparison shopping worldwide. It is the most convenient payment option for this scenario. As ecommerce becomes more and more prevalent, this comes closer and closer to a necessity. Some companies have created services which maximize Internet technology in this regard to full effect. \n\nThe ability to get cash advances. This eliminates the need to go to the bank as customers can simply get the cash they need from their grocery store or other merchant. Note that credit card companies do charge a percentage of the transaction as a fee for the cash advance. But in cases of emergencies or where there is an upper limit to the credit card company's service charge, this is a good option to have. \n\n\n\nDisadvantages of Credit Cards \n\n\n\nThe temptation to aquire too many credit card accounts can lead to losing track of payment details and deadlines. This can be disastrous. It can also lead to a false sense of security where customers continually transfer accounts to new services with lower interest. This rotating form of interest, if not properly disciplined and controlled can lead to balooning payments when late payments occur. When this happens, the interest rate on even the lowest APR credit card can suddenly explode. \n\nDifficulty with understanding the fine print as relating to various fees and charges which may not be initially obvious. It is important to understand how the interest rates on credit card charges is calculated and it is particularly important to keep up with payments. \n\nDepending on the credit card company, it is possible that falling behind with payments will result in an interest charge on all future charges regardless of whether or not you settle your bill during the grace period and by the normal deadline.9	Is there really over a million people making more than our president & dick put together also ? in the USA ?  even Madonna makes more...what is the incentive to go to college ?

Any thoughts on why you left and how you are doing now..and what your new spiritual convictions are would be GREAT! Hi, grew up Mormon, never really fit in.  I was baptized in three different faiths to kind of "wash the Mormon off me", and now have no religion, struggle with the idea of a god at all.

Even if every time you say it you think of God. For example if a baby falls, I might say "oh my God" almost like a prayer. Is that right or am I just making an excuse for a bad habit. No. To take the Lord's name in vain is when it's used to deceive someone.\n\nHey I don't like hearing it and try to refrain from doing it but just to say "Oh my God", is not what is meant.\n\nExo 20:7  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. \n\nVAIN H7723 שׁו    שׁואo shâv'  shav shawv, shav\nFrom the same as H7722 in the sense of desolating; evil (as destructive), literally (ruin) or morally (especially guile); figuratively idolatry (as false, subjectively), uselessness (as deceptive, objectively; also adverbially in vain): - false (-ly), lie, lying, vain, vanity.3	i want to select a beautiful secretary?  make sure you employ one then put in to job description \nsorry i already have a job otherwise i am sure i would fit the bill6	Wahts the one thing about ur past you'll never tell ur mate?

Electricial: power plants, power grid, generation and disribution of electricity\n\nElectronics: monitors and control circuits1	what is quantum mechanics?  quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of theoretical physics that replaces classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, and nuclear physics. Along with general relativity, quantum mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physic\n    \n\nThe term quantum (Latin, "how much") refers to discrete units that the theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1, at right). The discovery that waves could be measured in particle-like small packets of energy called quanta led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems which we today call Quantum Mechanics. The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli and others. Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory than Newtonian mechanics and classical electromagnetism, in the sense that it provides accurate and precise descriptions for many phenomena that these "classical" theories simply cannot explain on the atomic and subatomic level. It is necessary to use quantum mechanics to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if Newtonian mechanics governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus. However, in the natural world the electron normally remains in a stable orbit around a nucleus — seemingly defying classical electromagnetism.\n\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to explain the atom, especially the spectra of light emitted by different atomic species. The quantum theory of the atom developed as an explanation for the electron's staying in its orbital, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and by classical electromagnetism.\nhope this helps u out....\nhave a great day......6	Family Tax?

Can you please help with info or where i can get all the info we need to make the move to the states. We currently have a uk civil partnership. Thanks for you time... As of now, there is no gay marriage in New Jersey. On October 25, 2006 New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that homosexuals are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals, but gave the state legislature 180 days to decide if those same rights would be in the form of a civil union or a marriage. Due to this ruling, New Jersey can either be like Massachusetts and recognize gay marriage or like Vermont and Connecticut and recognize civil unions. It is important to note that, even though a few states recognize either civil unions or marriage that those laws only apply to those individual states; there is NO RECOGNITION of either gay marriage or civil unions by the US Federal Government. \n\nMassachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage. Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions. California has a domestic partnership law that provides most (but not all) spousal benefits to unmarried couples.

I undersatnd in regular gene therapy the healthy gene is introduced into a cell by a viral vector but how does stem cell gene therapy work? It doesn't yet.  Most current stem cell therapies use adult stem cells from the patients own body.  They are simply extracted from one area and put into another.  They are not genetically altered in any way.  A method currently being developed is to use SCNT to created a 'cloned' stem cell that would match the patient exactly.  Actual gene therapy for humans is a long way off, owing to the difficulty in actually getting any vector to deliver the gene to enough cells in an effective manner.5	Whats up with the Dallas kicker, Mike Vanderjagt, I thought he was the MOST accurate kicker in the league?

Mosses have no true roots and no true vascular system (at least not as derived as the higher platns). That means they can't extract nutrients from soil very well, they can't distribute nutrients efficiently, and they can't anchor themselves as firmly to the ground as higher plants. They also require water (mostly splashing rain) for reproduction. These limitation restrict moss to a low growing life-style in moist habitats where they can grow in dense groups for structural support.2	How can we increase the size of the breast of a women who is 22 years old in age.please let me know the method can anybody let me know how can we increase the size of the breast of the woman who has a very less size of the breast The only definitive way to increase breast size is to have implants done.

The Respiratory System consists of organs that deliver oxygen to the circulatory system for transport to all body cells. The goals of the respiratory system are to provide oxygen to the tissues and to remove carbon dioxide.\n\nRespiration includes 2 processes: external respiration and internal respiration. The former involves the absorption of O2 and removal of CO2 from the body as a whole preventing the lethal buildup of this waste product in body tissues. This process involves two major functional events: (1) pulmonary ventilation, which means the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the lung alveoli; (2) diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood (Guyton, 1991). The internal respiration entails the utilization of O2, which is essential for cells to liberate the energy needed for cellular activities and production of CO2 and the gaseous exchanges between the cells and their fluid medium.  It is divided into two major functional events: (3) transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the cells; and (4) regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration (Guyton, 1991).\n\nThe respiratory and circulatory systems work together to deliver oxygen to cells and remove carbon dioxide in following the two-phase processes as mentioned in the former paragraph. The first phase of respiration begins with breathing in, or inspiration. Inspiration brings air from outside the body into the lungs. Oxygen in the air moves from the lungs through blood vessels to the heart, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body (Microsoft, 2003). Oxygen then moves from the bloodstream into cells, which completes the first phase of respiration. In the cells, oxygen is used in a separate energy-producing process called cellular respiration, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct (Microsoft, 2003). The second phase of respiration begins with the movement of carbon dioxide from the cells to the bloodstream. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide to the heart, which pumps the carbon dioxide-laden blood to the lungs (Microsoft, 2003). In the lungs, breathing out, or expiration, removes carbon dioxide from the body, thus completing the respiration cycle. \n\nThe respiratory system is made up of a gas-exchanging organ (the lungs) and a pump that ventilates the lungs. The pump consists of: (1) the chest wall; (2) the respiratory muscles, which increase and decrease the size of the thoracic cavity; (3) the areas in the brain that control the muscles; and (4) the tracts and nerves that connect the brain to the muscles (Ganong, 1995). At rest, a normal person breaths 12-15 times a minute. Five hundred milliliters of air per breath, or 6-8 L/min, is inspired and expired (Ganong, 1995). This air mixes with the gas in the alveoli, and by simple diffusion, O2 enters the blood in the pulmonary capillaries while CO2 enters the alveoli.  In this manner, 250 mL of O2 enters the body per minute and 200 mL of CO2 is excreted (Ganong, 1995). During quiet breathing, the decrease in pressure in the chest starts about 2.5 mm Hg (compared to the outside pressure), decreasing to around 6 mm Hg towards the end of inspiration. Strong breathing efforts can produce a pressure decrease (vacuum) in the chest as high as 30 mm Hg. Day-in and day-out, without the prompt of conscious thought, the respiratory system carries out its life-sustaining activities. If the respiratory system’s tasks are interrupted for more than a few minutes, serious, irreversible damage to tissues occurs, followed by the failure of all body systems, and ultimately, death.\n\nThe respiratory system also plays other important roles in the body aside from the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. It helps regulate the balance of pH (acidity and basicity) in tissues, a process crucial for the normal functioning of cells. It protects the body against disease-causing organisms and toxic substances inha4	I need a good/creative name for a piece of e-commerce software - does anyone have any ideas?

You eat. You cannot gain weight without eating... in the exact opposite of losing weight, actually, you cannot gain weight without consuming more calories than you burn off. \n\nThe bigger question, in our weight-loss worshipping world, is why would you want to gain weight? Fact is that sometimes we become too thin, dangerously so, to the point where we begin to suffer all these negative side effects and eventually death. Sometimes gaining weight is a pretty attractive option by comparison. Being at a healthy weight helps every system of our body function better, allows us to heal from damage, and gives us reserves as protection against stress or illness as well. \n\nThe tougher part of weight-gain is how to do it in a healthy manner. Just as rapid weight-loss can be dangerous, so can rapid weight gain. Many EDs who go through rapid recovery end up with too high a bodyfat percentage, too much fat stored around their internal organs, compromised health, and high cholesterol. This is in part because traditional anorexic "recovery" diets are aimed at bulking up the patient as quickly as possible by fat-loading everything they eat with no thought for the health quality of the food being given. \n\nIt's safer to aim for a gain of one or two pounds a week so as to not put undue stress on your recovering system and to know that you're rebuilding bone, muscle, and nutrient stores instead of just frantically storing fat. It's more important to restore your body's protein, elemental, vitamin, water, fat and sugar balances than to simply send the numbers on the scale up. Once you do this, given sufficient raw materials your body will rebuild itself more strongly. \n\n\n \nIn The Beginning\n\nIf you're deciding to gain weight, odds are it's because you're underweight. If you're underweight, barring a purely illness-related weight-loss problem which should really be addressed by a doctor instead, you have probably not been eating enough. If you haven't been eating enough for a while, your digestive system will need to be retrained. Same goes for extended or extensive purging... it screws with your entire system, and there will need to be plenty of time devoted to patience and healing. \n\nExtended periods of time with insufficient solid food intake causes your entire digestive system to slow down and lose efficiency. Amounts of digestive chemicals in production may drop, and the tiny fingerlike cilia that absorb foods in your small intestine may become paralyzed or die off. The peristaltic muscles that move food through your system may weaken or atrophy. Large meals or a lot of food at once may confuse your stomach and intestines to the point where they cramp up and have trouble remembering what to do at all. All this will need to be repaired slowly, given time to reaccustom itself to the concept of processing and utilizing food again. \n\nStart with liquids. Rehydration is extremely important, since without food our overall water content drops significantly, and the digestive process requires a great deal of water. In the first few days of refeeding you may notice a sudden gain of several pounds... this is most likely, if you're doing everything right, your water balance trying to straighten itself out.5	Other than the obvious choice, Carolina Panthers, what teams will persevere in the 2006 season?

Pilonidal cyst ??? Pilonidal cyst ???\nwhat is it? how do you get it?\ni said that i was having unbearable pain around my tailbone area... could this be what it possibly is? \nthere are no visable lumps, bumps, or "pimples" of any kind...\ni have not poped anything, as right now there is nothing to pop. \ncould it be under the skin? so that i can not see it? I always thought that I just had a tailbone that bruised easily until one time last spring when the pain started getting worse and it turned out that' I've always had a pilonidal cyst. I recccommend going to the doctor or the ER if you don't have a doctor. If it's a cyst and hurts that much, there's a good chance it can't drain on it's own and you'll have to have it lanced. Waiting will only make it worse.  The actual cyst is congential, but I think there are several different reasons it can become infected.2	I am having trouble breathing, what could be wrong? Since last Friday I have been having breathing difficulties. It feels as though something is catching in my chest every time I draw in breath. Inhaling Vicks helps a bit but so far nothing else I have tried has helped. I am not asthmatic and I don't feel sick at all. My husband made me go to the ER on Sunday, the doctor I saw told me that my throat looked a bit red but my chest was clear and nothing could be done unless it got worse. It hasn't gotten worse but it is no better either. If it does not get better in a day or two, or if it gets any worse, go back to the doctor.\n\nAnxiety can cause trouble breathing. If you have a lot of stress or something happened to cause anxiety, that could be the cause. If so, back to the doctor for something to calm down.0	Do you dread the future?

Please help me,i will give you 10 points.Please write the code of C++ using class I'd love to help you, but I'm not sure what you're looking for.  Part of the problem, perhaps, is that while I'm a good computer programmer with 12+ years programming in C++ I'm really lousy with finances and I'm not sure I could work out interest by hand.\n\nBut even if I could, it makes no sense to develop this as a class if you don't have either related functions or persistant data.  I can't envision this taking more than one function to implement unless you stretch it some.  But if you were to stretch it, try this:\n\nclass InterestCalculator\n{\npublic:\n   InterestCalculator()  {SetRate(0.05);}\n   void SetRate(double r) {Rate = r;}   //Add error checking here\n   double CalcInterest(double money, int months);\n\nprivate:\n   double Rate;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\nInterestCalculator calc;\n\ncalc.SetRate(0.10); //set rate to 10 percent;\n\ncout << "$500 for two years at a 10% rate has an interest of " << calc.CalcInterest(500, 24) << endl;\n}\n\nNow, that's a rather contrived solution, designed to use a class even where it makes little sense to do so.  I don't know if this helps or not. I've left the implementation of calculating the interest rate to you (as I said, I'm not sure how to do it even by hand).\n\nIf you have more information on what else the class should do so that it makes more sense as a class, modify your question here or shoot me an e-mail and I'll see what help I can be.\n\nGood luck.1	why cant elephants jump?

Well, from the tech specs on Intel.com, it looks like you have only one PCI expansion slot.  Since you have no AGP or PCIe slots, you are not going to be able to get the best performing graphics cards on the market right now as they work with those two slot types.\n\nThat being said, I prefer NVIDIA for all of my graphics cards.  That is just my personal preference.  They perform well and are relatively inexpensive.  I have the AGP form of the BFG GeForce 5500 in my computer and it serves my needs quite well.  They have a PCI version of it as well that i would suggest you going with.  The motherboard that oyu have seems a little old, but it should work wih it as long as you get the right drivers, which you may have to get online as I do not know if those proper drivers will come with the card.

Yesterday someone posted a question in which she described how legal immigration affected the United States. Her argument was that if immigration kept its current increase numbers, then by year 2030 the population would triple and that this would cause America to be a third world country. I have a problem with this, since I am a legal immigrant myself. What is your opinion? I don't know who posted that question, but the premise is silly.  From an economic standpoint, America gains from immigration (legal and illegal).  \n\nThose that legally enter America do so because we are a land of opportunity.  They are able to apply their skills and talents to better themselves.  In the meantime, they are part of the population that find better ways of doing things (technological advances).  Technological advances increase everyones standard of living.  \n\nThose that come here illegally are hired by firms because of the cheapness of their labor.  This lowers the costs of products that all Americans buy.  If this wasn't true, then there wouldn't be an illegal immigration problem.  The government would have taken care of it long ago.  But, in the end, money talks so the political question on illegal immigration will not be decided in the near future.  There is a lot of disagreement over this.  Many people contend that illegal immigration overwhelms government programs costing the country more in services than their labor provides.  For myself, I wonder how much the American consumer has saved through lower prices compared to what they pay in taxes so the  government can pay for those services.  Granted individual states may experience problems, but my bet is that for the nation as a whole, the American consumer is the beneficiary.\n\nAs an example, our population recently went over 300 million people; a 20 million increase from 5 years ago.  This was attributed to immigration.  Has our standard of living gone down?  No, it has gone up.  That's because these people are working.  They increase our GDP.  Even if they do not provide for increases in knowledge and technological breakthroughs (which everyone does through specialization), the proportional split on GDP is the same as if they did not immigrate.   \n\nMy thoughts on illegal immigration are solely from an economic viewpoint.  From a societal, security, etc. viewpoint, I think we must stop illegal immigration.  I fully support legal immigration and believe it is a strength in America.\n\nSorry so long, but I can be a chatty bugger.7	Whats Cherish's Album Name?

A good punch is a full body movement. A powerful punch comes more from your legs, shoulders, and stomach, than from your arms.  Get a heavy bag, and just work on punch combos for a week or two.  Don't go full force, because if you haven't done much boxing your wrists won't be able to handle the stress at first.  Do lots of push ups and sit-ups.  Doing push ups on your knuckles will also help get your wrists stronger.  Once you have some speed, then start working on adding power.  A jab is to stun, and its just a quick hit.  When you want to do damage you want to use more weight, and drive the punch into them for optimal damage.\n\nDo like a right jab, left cross, right power, solid left to the body, then a power right to the stomach, as they hunch down from having the wind knocked out of them, just give them a right cross from your elbow. Boom, fights over in about a second flat.\n\nReally tho, fighting should always be the last option.  If you are an experienced fighter, you can do lots of damage with a single blow.  Fights rarely last anywhere near as long as they last in movies, or boxing.  A single solid un-gloved hit to the head will end most fights.... One good hit can cause...

Then I'll be back in a while with some real advice.http://www.webheights.net/GrowingbeyondEmotionalAbuse/evans/cp.htm\n\nHere is a website about a book by Patricia Evans. It's called "Controlling People":\n\n\nAn excerpt--Does this sound like\nsomeone you know?\n\n\nAlways needs to be right \nTells you who you are and what you think \nImplies that you're wrong or inadequate when you don't agree \nIs threatened by people who are "different" \nFeels attacked when questioned \nDoesn't seem to really hear or see you \nIf any of the above traits sounds familiar, help is on the way! In Controlling People, bestselling author Patricia Evans (The Verbally Abusive Relationship) tackles the "controlling personality," and reveals how and why these people try to run other people's lives. She also explains the compulsion that makes them continue this behavior -- even as they alienated others and often lose those they love.\n\nControlling People helps you unravel the senseless behavior that plagues both the controller and the victim. Can the pattern, or spell, be broken? Yes! says the author.\n\nBy understanding the compelling force involved, you can be a catalyst for change and actually become a spell-breaker. Once the spell is broken and the controller sees others as they really are, a genuine connection can be forged and healing can occur.\n\nShould you ever find yourself in the thrall of someone close to you, Controlling People is here to give you the wisdom, power, and comfort you need to be a stronger, happier, and more independent person.\n\nAbout the Author\n  \n Patricia Evans is the founder of the Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute in Alamo, CA. She conducts workshops across the country, and has made numerous media appearances. Her first book, The Verbally Abusive Relationship, was praised by Newsweek as "groundbreaking." \n\n" If someone defines you, even in subtle ways, they are pretending to know the unknowable. There is a quality of fantasy to their words and sometimes to their actions. Even so, they are usually unaware of the fact that they are playing "let's pretend." They fool themselves and sometimes others into thinking that what they are saying is true or that what they are doing is right.\n\nWhen people "make up" your reality -- as if they were you -- they are trying to control you, even when they don't realize it.\n\nWhen people attempt to control you they begin by pretending. When they define you they are acting in a senseless way. They are pretending. When people act as if you do not exist or are not a real person with a reality of your own...they are pretending. In this subtle and often unconscious way, they are attempting to exert control over you -- your space, time, resources, or even your life.\n\nTo control is to act to effect an outcome, generally by means of restraint, physical or verbal, with regard to self, others, or the world around one.\n\nThere are two kinds of control. One is the nurturing control that we have over ourselves, our lives, and those entrusted to our care. The other is oppressive control.\n\nNurturing control supports one's own and others' freedom to be themselves, while oppressive control does just the opposite. Most people exercise nurturing control throughout their lives by the choices they make and the actions they take to ensure their own and others' sustenance and survival: to put off immediate gratification for a future good; to manage their resources -- money, time, space, and environment; to pursue their work and their relationships; and to care for their children and their families. In other words, to direct their lives, but not at the expense of another.\n\nWhen Pretenders connect backwards, anchor in someone, and then attempt to keep their8	i like this guy but last year he played with my heart.should i take a chance on him this year? he may like me?

The pay you rare referring to is called Quarters, and Variable Housing Allowance.  Back when I was in the military, I got 465 a month, for Quarters and VHA while I lived in an apartment.  When I moved onto base housing, they took that part off my pay.\n\nThe policy will vary from base to base.  If you are stationed where the housing is very good, then it is likely that the housing will be full.  In that case there will be a waiting list.  In some cases those with kids may get priority, on others they may not.  Usually rank makes a difference as well.\n\nWhen I was in the Air Force, the housing was sub-standard.  So married military members E4 or below where required to take housing, and NCO’s could live off base.  Usually the power went out daily, the roof leaked, and the toilets backed up all the time.  The house was built in the 1940s with no air-conditioning, but were retro-fitted in the 1970’s.  They were in poor condition at best.  They have since been torn down and rebuilt.  Keep in mind that I got out in 1993.7	favourite dusty springfield song?  Son of a Preacher Man2	At night I just feel so tired and I can't keep my eyes open? Why does this happen?

Oprah,\nI have read some of the answers, but this keeps coming to my mind. We have to realize, there are so many people living here in the USA that needs help. I would find an elderly person ,maybe in a grocery store that don't have enough money to pay for their groceries, and pay for their groceries and make sure they have money for their medication. A person on a fixed income that can't make ends meet. So many elderly people don't have money for groceries or their medication. I am on a fixed income and it is so hard to buy me and my husband's medicine, groceries and bills. So I feel for the elderly so much. The government wants to send all this money over seas, and there are so many elderly people here in the USA who needs help. The government shoud open their eyes and help our country first. I would just love to take that very special elderly person, and take them and buy their medication and groceries, or anything else they might need, at least for 1 month. God bless our elderly. Oprah,\nI have read some of your answers and I am big fan your show.\nIf I gave $1000.00 thousand dollars to a stranger I would use the money for a foster family who needs the family for food medication water and a place to go to school and a  place to live for families who don't have a place to live.

If I could I can change one person or a whole country by giving a stranger just $1000.00 ten thousand dollars or even 10 million dollars this is what I would do for the people cause they need food and attention so badly and they would so grateful.1	what chemical is Pb(OH)2?  Lead(II) hydroxide\n\nPb is lead, the roman numeral II (2) indicates the charge of the lead, and OH is hydroxide.  Incidentally, everyone so far has missed the II, which is what distingishes Pb(OH)2 from Pb(OH)4 or lead (IV) hydroxide.\n\nPlumbous hydroxide is the old school name (sorry, but plumbium hydroxide is just plain wrong).  Plumbous comes from the latin word plumbium, meaning lead, which is also where that atomic symbol for lead (Pl) comes from.  Interestingly, Pb(OH)4 is commonly refered to by its old name, plumbic acid.\n\nRizza, lead carbonate would be PbCO3.1	does star have an orbit ???  All stars orbit something.

He said that Israel should be wiped off the face of the planet for one thing, and then in order to try to backpeddle from that he said that they should all move to Europe.  This is obviously a guy who might not be able of making reasonable decisions, especially when he sees the world in such a unreasonable viewpoint.1	What is the difference in philosophy and psychology?  Psychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of the mind, brain, and behavior, both human and nonhuman. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. \nPsychology differs from sociology, anthropology, economics, and political science in part because it involves studying the mental processes and behavior of individuals (alone or in groups) rather than the behavior of the groups or aggregates themselves. Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they subjectively produce.\n\n\nPhilosophy is a field of study that includes diverse subfields such as aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics, in which people ask questions such as whether God exists, whether knowledge is possible, and what makes actions right or wrong. The fundamental method of philosophy is the use of reasoning to evaluate arguments concerning these questions. However, the exact scope and methodology of philosophy is not rigid. What counts as philosophy is itself debated, and it varies across philosophical traditions.\n\nThe term philosophy comes from the Greek word "Φιλοσοφία" (philo-sophia), which means "love of wisdom". The term is notoriously difficult to define (see definition of philosophy) because of the diverse range of ideas that have been labeled as a philosophy. The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy defines it as the study of "the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action, and reality". The Penguin Encyclopedia says that philosophy differs from science in that philosophy's questions cannot be answered empirically, and from religion in that philosophy allows no place for faith or revelation. However, these points are called into question by the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, which states: "the late 20th-century... prefers to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry." Indeed, many of the speculations of early philosophers in the field of natural philosophy eventually formed the basis for modern scientific explanations on a variety of subjects.\n\nInformally, a "philosophy" may refer to a general world view or to a specific ethic or belief6	How mutual funds are different from shares? Which one is good & secure in terms of investment?  When you buy mutual funds, you are not buying stock in just one company. A Mutual Fund takes your money and combines it with other investors money to buy bulk lots of stock. Usually the funds are divided into low risk, moderate risk and aggresive funds. The lower the risk fund the more they diversify into safer bonds and large companies. The more aggresive the fund means that you are investing in smaller companies, but the chance for greater fund growth comes with these smaller companies, as well as more risk. Look in a newspaper and find the name of some mutual funds that have the letters nl. These are "no load" funds, which means you don't have to pay a broker fee to invest in them. Request an information package from the fund. It is much safer than buying individual stock.1	what is the difference between speed,velocity and accleration?  Speed = distance covered per unit of time without regard to direction (e.g. 55 miles per hour)\n\nVelocity = distance covered per unit of time with regard to direction (e.g. 55 miles per hour going south)\n\nAcceleration = increase in velocity over time (e.g. gaining 5 miles per hour every second)4	how can i stop someone from booting me? when i sign back their still booting me please clearify your question.

The original cult of the mother and child, Semiramis and Tammuz, became later Isis and Osiris, Venus and Adonis, the madonna and child in various cultures down to this day. \n\nSemiramis declared that her son, Tammuz, was in actuality the return or rebirth of her husband, Nimrod. this is where reincarnation was born. And since Tammuz was born on the day corresponding to December 25, this day was highly honored and recognized by Nimrod's supporters. Note, therefore, that this date (December 25) was observed in honor of the birth of Tammuz long before Christianity existed, and that it was not until many centuries later this pagan custom was "Christianized" as being the birthday of Christ (or Christmas day). "It can be stated they worship another Jesus" \n\nNimrod's followers began to also worship Semiramis. And her son Tammuz was worshipped as well. Semiramis was revered by the people and was viewed by many as a priestess and goddess. She soon became known as "the queen of heaven." Thus began the awful practice of exalting human deities. These false beliefs have led up to the many different forms of idolatry that are still practiced by different people today. Yes, it was through the introduction of these satanic evils and the many sacrilegious practices of ancient Babylon that witchcraft, priestcraft, spiritualism, and other forms of paganism were born. \n\nOn the 25th of December, is "The birthday of the unconquerable Sun" (Natalis Solis Invicti). The ancient pagans believed that the sun would die during the winter solstice and then rise again from death as the solstice ended and the days of light began to lengthen, with the sun climbing higher in the sky, regaining its dominance. December 25 was also regarded as the birth date of the Persian/Iranian mystery god Mithras, the Sun of Righteousness, the god of light, the Grand Deliverer. The Sun God Mithras was a popular deity in the Old Roman Empire, whose cult penetrated the Roman world in the first century B.C. Yes.

Most stats I've seen indicate that 70-75% of divorces are filed by women.\n\nI've also seen stats that put infidelity by men at about 60% and infidelity by women at about 40%, with women catching up to the infidelity rate of men.\n\nSo why do you think women, who typically complain than men are afraid of comittment, seem to want divorce two to three times more than do men?\n\nIt seems to me that men are more comitted to marriage than women.  Comments? Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job "isn't enough" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he "made that commitment" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were "liberated" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this "liberation" and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\n\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?2	Is there any excuse for obesity? I notice that in areas of the country where people exercize more ,for example near the ski mountains, there seems to be much fewer people with "gland problems" or  a "fat genes".  I also notice that there are far fewer people with these "medical conditions" in foreign countries where they eat healthier and in more moderate amounts. Yes. Some people are obese because of irreversible genetic disorders or adverse side effects of medication. For most people, which is 95% of obese people have no excuses. They eat too much of the wrong kinds of food and don't move enough. Ask a triathlete how much he/she eats, and you'll know that calories isn't an issue. It's about eating the right kinds of food, and treating food like fuel. In fact, endurance athletes are notorious for carb-loading. Obesity is about lard, over-consumption and not enough activity. Go out and cycle or run. IT works. I lost 30 lbs in 6 months that way without counting anything.2	if your mom had cancer will i get if i am the second child?

Actually there is no superconductor at room temperature(at least at this time being).\n\nhave u ever heard about Ohm's law\nohm's law stated that the voltage(V) is equal to electric  current(I) and resistance(R)\n                 V=IR\nif we manipulate the law, we get\n                 R=V/I\n\nIt means that we cannot have voltage and current without having resistance.\n\nWe don't want the resistance bcoz we didn't want to waste the voltage. in other word, material with high resistance is called insulator and the ones with low resistance is called conductor. we know electric can't pass trough insulator becoz it dont conduct electric. Unfortunately, all material in the universe have resistance. Wood n plastic have resistance so they cannot conduct electric. Metals such as cuprum, iron n so on also have resistance but in lower scale. therefore it can conduct electric but it also waste electric in form of heat. so everyday when we use elecrical gadjets we waste some electric.\n\nSuperconductor is the material that has 0 or as low as achievable resistance. Scientists find out that the lower the temperature the lower the resistance. so we can have 0 resistance at 0 kelvin or -273.15 centrigate.\n\nScientists have managed to find a combination of materials that can act as superconductor above 0 kelvin(or above -273.15 centrigate). i'm not remember but i think it is -100 something, centrigate. But until right now, no one has manage to find the right combination of materials to make superconductor at room temperature.\n\n\nShould we manage to make one, the whole world will get the benefits from it.

Perhaps the most obvious is that the Scottish Parliament has control over Health Expenditure and is prepared to devote more money that it's equivalent in England. As to why this is, is a matter of opinion. Some people may argue that Scotland health departmant is more efficient. Other people may say the "Barnett Formula" introduced in 1978 provides more money for Scotland than England and Wales.

So many people are judgemental is it any wonder that the grave problems between the Israeli Jews and the Palestinians have made no progress whatsoever?\n\nThe Palistinians know of no other way to fight for their existance against the most technically superior and heavily armed force in the Middle East - Israel.  \n\nWhat other action can they resort to now that will enable them to live freely and justly in the country they reside in other than sacrificing themselves as human bombs?  \n\nIt is tragic that in the 21st Century the political men in the World are incapable of having the courage to produce a solution that will enable Palistinians and Israelis to 'integrate' justly and with compassion.  \n\nI know for a fact that the attitude of the Israeli police and border guards to Palistinians is nothing short of arrogant - even to a British subject on vacation. Palistinians gueue from 2.00 am to cross checkpoints to get to work by 9.00 am - what kind of treatment is that and what kind of behaviour is that? \n\nThe Palistinians organised what was acknowledged as a democratic election - the only problem was that the democratically elected party wasn't the party which other prople/countries wanted.  \n\nThe big mistake the democratically elected Hamas government made was not to renounce 'terrorism'.  What it should have done was to form their own 'Defence Force' in uniform under the authority of the government, made up of those who are trying to preserve the human rights of their fellow men, women and children - so blatently abused by Israel - evidenced by UN resolutions which are ignored by Israel.\n\nAre we expected to forget the virtual wipe-out of Lebanon by Israel just weeks ago - that seems to have disappeared from the media - and one has to ask why - although I suspect we all know that money talks in politics.\n\nMy emotions are mixed - I really would like to think that all the inhabitants of the land called Israel and Palestine could live together side by side in peace.  \n\nThe Israelis may have suffered deaths at the hands of the Palistinian suicide bombers, but the Palistinians have also suffered death by Israeli military forces in addition to the  loss of their livelihoods and their farmland.  At least the Israelis can go about their daily lives and employment - something denied to the Palistinians by the Israelis.5	What players do you think are going to peform well in the upcoming world cup?

Given all the technology and richess we have here on Earth. Fact is there is more than enough food produced on the planet to feed everyone. In the Untied states alone we produce 3 times the amount need to feed our people, yet there is still starvation in this country.\n\nThe only answer to why is politics. One side says that its wrong to just give way food, that the poor must work for it, the government has no buisness funding programs.\n\nOn a global scale it is much more complicated. and population is not the reason it can not be solved.\nMajor reasons include.\n\n*unstable governments in the poorest nations.\nWaring nations.\n*Lack of Prioritization of the problem by stable rich nations.\n*Lack of Funding to distrubute food, lack of storage facilities.\n*Lack of evironmental regulations..(rivers and oceans, ect ect)\n\nBut if you want the simplest answer...is that mankind is flawed. They nation before humanity, they see borders before need. They say there is no solution so they do not try.\nIs there a soultion to that....I am not sure.7	What are some songs from the the roaring 20's (1920's) and famous singers?

After closing down my claim for non return of IB50 form, DWP have reinstated my claim, but are refusing to back-date the payments, although written requests have been made.  What are my rights? Talk to a Welfare Rights Officer at your local Social Work Department immedidaetely and appeal this decision. You must complete and return the IB50 failure to do aso means that your Incapacity Benefit/Income Support will stop. if you have "Goodcause" for not returning the form the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must reinstate it, Goodcause could be that it wasn't resaonable to return it due to your state of mind etc. It looks like the DWP have accepted your Goodcause and reinstated, this should then be fully backdated to make a continous claim. They can not disallow you for a period in the middle. If they have done so get a letter of decision from them asking why this has been done and under what legislation. The decision letter must state your appeal rights. For the DWP to have done this they would have had to supecede your intial decision, this can be appealed against and it is up to them to prove your are not entitled. Ask for a full written statement of reasons but seek the support of a WRO immedidately and they will assist with this.4	Who can tell me stuff about Torrents?

A resistant variety may be less preferred by the insect pest, adversely affect its normal development and survival, or the plant may tolerate the damage without an economic loss in yield or quality. Disease-resistant vegetables are widely used, whereas insect-resistant varieties are less common but nonetheless important. Examples include varieties of wheat which have tough stems that prevent development of the Hessian fly and cucurbits (squash, cucumbers, melons) that have lower concentrations of feeding stimulants (cucurbitacins) for cucumber beetles. Commercial corn lines with increased concentration of a chemical called DIMBOA display resistance to European corn borer, a major pest throughout the world. In the case of cabbage, the only reliable method of controlling onion thrips is through the use of resistant varieties.\n\nhttp://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/info/ipmtact.html5	if you have three feet does it make you walk faster or slower?

The equation relating wavelength to frequency is:\n\nL = c / f\n\nwhere L is the wavelength in meters and c is the speed of light in meters per second and f is the frequency in cycles per second (Hz).  L here is technically supposed to be a lambda (the upside-down y-shape, a greek letter) but since I can't type that easily in Y!A I'll just use "L"\n\nThe units are:\nmeters/cycle = (meters/second) / (cycles/second)\n\nSo, L = 3*10^8 / 3*10^4 = 1*10^4 meters (10,000 meters)0	What is Hindu Culture ?

I don't have anything particular in mind, just that my ex aggrivated me immensely because she would act like we were going out (holding hands, quick kisses, etc.) but if anyone asked her, she would deny that she was attracted to girls and tell them that I was just barking up the wrong tree.  She wouldn't even tell people be both knew were Kinsey2s or higher that she liked girls, and I don't understand that at all.  Of course if you're not sure how someone will take it, excercise caution, but if you know they're gay, why not gain an ally, as it were?  Also, a current very good friend of mine who I am almost sure is a K6 (maybe a 5) lists her preference as straight on myspace and won't let me post anything that makes her sound gay.  Don't these girls realize that there is as much support as hatred out there if you know where to look?  Why are they ashamed of who they are?  Lastly - is dating someone like this a good idea? OMG my x did the same exact thing to me.  My x broke up with me, but she will still hug and kiss me.  Like she keeps reeling me back in.  Confusing i know.  When we were first going out she made it quite clear that she could never come out to her parents.  Then a few days ago she says that she is really only 20% gay.  What a slam in the face to me.  She won't accept anything of who she is.  Maybe she believes that denying the truth will make her life easier. I really don't know if dating someone like this is a great idea, but it depends on how much you care for them.  I still love my x a lot and if she wanted to get back together i would be all for it, but at the same time i don't get the full benefits of a healthy relationship.  The only quetion you need to ask is if the good out weighs the bad.  Do you still enjoy being around her?  If her denial is upsetting you that much then maybe it is better to break it off, but if you still seriously care for her, then it makes it a little more difficult to just let go.8	Help please? Ok.

If a beam of light were to travel down an infinate tube, would it ever stop and if not, why not? this is a category mistake.\n\nADDED COMMENT:\nwell, the way i see it, there are two possible interpretations of your question: a) Does a beam of light ever run out of energy?, or b) Does a beam of light ever stop moving?\n\n(a) is a category mistake because light is energy.  it's not something that has energy.  it just IS energy.  so, the answer using this interpretation is simply no, because it's nonsensical to say that energy loses energy.\n\n(b) can be attacked similarly.  light is being treated as something moving, which seems okay on the face of it, but i don't think it's quite right to treat it that way.  i don't think i'm going to articulate this point successfully (i may be wrong on this anyway), so i'll give you a funny account of why (unimpeded) light will always continue to 'move'.\n\nThe key thing to note is that motion is a relation.  For there to be motion, there have to be at least two things: the thing 'moving' and the thing it is moving in relation to.  if there is only one thing, there is no way to know if it is moving.  if we are to say something is moving, we have to provide the frame of reference too.  e.g. driving in my car, i am moving in relation to the road.  in relation to my car, however, i am not moving.\n\nlight is different than moving objects, however.  einstein's theory of special relativity holds that light travels at the same speed in all frames of reference.  so, it's safe to say that from any possible vantage point (moving at any possible speed), light will always be 'moving' in relation to you, and at the same speed.  so, no, the beam (if unimpeded) will never stop moving.\n\ni hope this is clear enough to be of help.\nalso, if i didn't do your question justice, let me know.  i'd be willing to take another crack at it.4	Where can I find downloadable music videos legaly?

I have worked with both Mac's and PC's and i totally vote for the macbook.  The operating system is much more stable and will last longer than another laptop because they are built stronger in my opinion.  PC's are good also if you are in an environment that is PC dominated or if you want to try out software (software for Macs are limited).  Macs are great if you are doing photos, videos and other creative stuff. I belive Apple also ships their computers rapidly and would receive it much faster than a PC if you are travelling soon.7	which song and video clip of guns 'n' roses do you prefer???? isn't axl rose wonderful even now that he is 44???? since i don't have you\nnovember rain\nknocking on heaven's door8	How many people don't get engagement rings? I've heard of couples with really cheap wedding/engagement rings or just none at all... Yes, it happens.  But I've found the "cheap" rings usually mean more than the expensive ones.\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we were poor college students with no jobs so he couldn't afford an engagement ring.  On our honeymoon, we went to a small antique store and saw a beautiful ring -- it was bright green crystal set in sterling silver -- and it was $10.  The man we bought it from warned it was expensive.  Since my husband had $10, he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my "very expensive ring".  Although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor, I love that ring and will never get another one.  For me, it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world.2	How do I stop under arm sweating?

Evolution is a scientific theory.

The fact is that the tehory of evolution by natural selection is a) scientifically founded and b) not at odds with a belief in God.\n\nIf you don't agree with eveolution being taught, then quite frankly, you don't agree with the idea of teaching science at all.  It is all consostent with scientific methodology.  If that's the case, then oppose all science, and don't just pick-and-choose which findings you're going to take issue with.\n\n*********edit*********\nWHAT'S WITH THIS "EQUAL TIME" CRAP?!?!?  Would you guys suggest equal time for alchemy and chemistry?  For astrology and astronomy?  For Newtonian physics and psychokinetics?\n\nWhat you all are missing is that even if ID/Creationism is correct, it has NO USE TO HUMANS.  Period.  I cannot manipulate the theory of creationism to create a vaccine, the way I can manipulate evolution.  School is not about some sort of all-out investigation into Divine Truth; it is meant to be practical.  And like it or not, the theory of evolution by natural selection has practical applications.  We do not teach how to use the ALTAIR computer, because it's pointless; not because the functioning of it is any "less true" than the modern PC.  We do not teach basket weaving or bricklaying in school, because they have very little usefulness.  But every person who ever takes antibiotics or who ever uses a disinfectant on the kitchen counter can learn something useful about the nature of evolution.  This "choice" notion is utterly ridiculous.  Should phrenology be taught side-by-side with classical conditioning?  Should Swahili be taught with the same regularity that Spanish is taught?  You people are talking nonsense.\n\nDo you really want the national dialogue on the nature of God to be controlled by the Federal Government?  Do you have the faintest idea how detrimental that would be to the American Christian community? THINK!!!!!\n\nFor Schneb: random variation is only a PART of evolution.  Natural Selection is an entirely non-random process.  I'd wager a few thousand dollars that one could easily make a program that would randomly trigger pixels on the monitor, and select and retain pixels that had some resemblance of the WIndows logo, and in time, one would get a refined and accurate Windows logo.  Randomness in variation is only a part of the picture, and you ideologues have decided to cling to that part of the theory and ignore the rest--especially ignoring the vast amount of biochemical support for the theory, none of which could have been known to Darwin--in order to distort the case for the theory, which is very, very strong.\n\nDo you realize how long a billion years really is?  Life has been around for ~3.5 BILLION years.  Today you will pass 100 billion to 10 trillion E. coli into the toilet.  Think about the size of these numbers!  Think about the number of generations in the vast, vast oceans!  These sorts of statistically "impossible" things happne all the time.  Do you realize that the entire function of the neurons that let you read this depend on trillions of random moleculra collisions that eventually reach the right spot?  It's all random, Brownian motion that allows ions to diffuse in and out of the channels, that makes the gates open and close, that makes the synaptobrevin and synatotagmin and SNAP-25 proteins collide and fuse the cells membranes to spill the neurotransmitter into the cleft where it will randomly bump around the synapse and then randomly bind to a post-synaptic receptor, all before randomly bouncing around until it hits the reuptake proteins that will sequester the neurotransmitter.  I'm not making any of that up, and it happnes billions and billions of times just1	why is 1+1=1 in booles algebra axiom?  You can save a lot of calculation by simply remembering one sentence: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BooleanRing.html .\nThis type of ring is useful in logic because in a logical statement, two true statements yield a true statement when conjuncted or disjuncted and thus the truth function taking statements into their truth value is a homomorphism into this ring.9	Who was the worst president ever?

A pass first shoot second floor general in Marcus Williams. That would be sick dude. It might not work the first year but one or two years down the road this would be insane in the membrane.

I am referring to a home pc. If I closed all the running programs and logged off, then just turn the pc off using the powerpoint would this harm it? I guess you're saying either turn it off with the power switch or pulling the power.  Neither way is a recommended method.  Even if you've closed all programs there are still processes running in the background in Windows.  Doing the Shut Down procedure in Windows is the preferred way because it stops everything and then turns it off.  Now sometimes it's not avoidable such as during a lockup but that's the only time I would suggest doing that.  Over many times of shutting the machine off improperly you will get system errors.9	If somebody refuses to enter a plea in court or talk to anyone in court , what will they do? I assume the court will accept a plea of not guilty on his behalf but what about after that? If the guy is not talking at all, not to his lawyer or anybody at all. He does not even say that he wants a lawyer, how does the court go ahead with proceedings? Will they assign him to a mental home? will they make a lawyer for him anyway? Most likely the judge will enter a not guilty plea and assign a public defender. You will be found guilty and be sentenced. Did you really think keeping your mouth shut would stop them! Now if you can convince them you are mentally incompetent or unable to understand what is going on, you may get a mental hospital, but that's a real long shot and they will have you evaluated 1st by court appointed doctors.0	The Da Vinci Code... Do you Believe? why/why not? Do you not think this is even semi-possible and makes sense? would you hope this is right or prefer it to be wrong? either way, it's fascinating right?\n\n(If I were to go back to my catholicism ways... I would believe this... it makes more sense to me. If the bible were to make sense... I would still be Roman Catholic. Please Do Not Preach to one who has Preached.) Why do so many people insist that DaVinci Code is "fiction"? Actually it contains both fiction and fact. This is the typical Christian propaganda machine in action which sweepingly makes the whole book fiction when in fact there are many true things in it. So it's fact & fiction just like the bible (though the bible contains far more fiction than DVC).0	I want Quran sharif in arabic text only to read, without translation . can anybody help?

Govt is not allowed to have ANY form of registration for guns and gun owners, thank goodness and thank the NRA. However, F*cked up states like CA and NY do require registration IF you are EVEN allowed to purchase a firearm. \nYou did not specify what state you are in, so it is difficult to answer your question of whether or not you can purchase a firearm in another state and keep it in another, you need to edit your question and be specific.\n I do, however, understand your plight. I'm from CA and when I returned from my enlistment, I was infuriated I could not purchase a firearm with out waiting for weeks for a 'cool down' period and paying outrageous fees. So I got a job where I was allowed to carry a gun and used that everywhere I went. But it's hard to go around irrational laws this way so not everyone can do this. I also understand the concern of having to register your guns with ANYONE. People like some of the other answerer's immediately think you are up to no good when you wanna PURCHASE a firearm but forget that personal protection is not guaranteed by the police, only yourself. \nYou can purchase a firearm in a surrounding state like Arizona and even 'open' carry it without a permit in THAT state, but you have to list a residential address in that state and you cannot transport the firearm back to CA, where I THINK  you are from, without listing it in that state,(CA). I can be of more help if you are more specific in your state.3	Prep, or Public? I have been given the option to either attend catholic prepatory school or public school. Which one would be better?

For organisms that are rapidly reproducing there isn;t any real limit to the number of individuals required. One of each will work just fine. That's because the degree of genetic diversity will be increasing simply through re-assortment, and with an increasing population mutations will be arising more than fast enough to replace any losses.\n\nThe thing we need to know is how fast you think people are going to be able to expand, and that depends entirely on where these two survivors are located. In relatively benign environments such as the eastern US or Southern India people would be able to increase their populations exponentially immediately. In those circumstances two survivors would work. In more hostile environments such as Australia or Siberia people would find life a struggle for a long time and you'd probably need a good few hundred.8	WHY do we ALWAYS want MORE than what we HAVE???? why are some people never satisfied with what they have?

F=ma. force on an object(the car) is equal to the mass(weight)of the car times the acceleration(or in the case of an accident the deceleration).\nIt's harder to determine the force on a passenger because the seatbelt is designed to minimize the impact of an accident. airbags do too!4	Where can I go to take an advanced training course in Microsoft Access?

A scrapbook of his life - gather pictures, newspaper articles and other things that have significance. For example, my grandfater turned 90 last year and spent much of World War II as a Navy doc on Alcatraz - we gathered pictures from his life, even ones with my Gma who passed away about 10 years ago - all leading up to current times. He totally loved it! We found articles in old newspapers that were relevant to him and life as he remembers it.
