14	gather the necessary equipment : to practice the suturing techniques , you will need a suture pad .
14	hold the tools correctly : for right - handed people , hold the needle holder with your right ring finger and thumb .
14	with the needle holder , take out the needle from its package . make sure to pull all the thread out .
14	using the tissue forceps , expose the skin towards the end of the right side of the wound .
14	parallel to the first bite , puncture the left side of the skin the same way as you did in the last step .
14	hold the needle with the needle holder ( without the need to hear a click ) and pull so that all the thread , except for about 3 - 5 centimeter ( 1 - 2 in ) , is on the left side of the wound .
14	after releasing the needle from the needle holder , use your left hand to hold the thread near the wound and wrap it approximately a cm or two from the tip around the closed needle holder.make sure to wrap the thread three times outward ( clockwise ) while keeping the thread in close proximity to the wound . note : the direction in which you wrap the thread does not matter as long as it alternates between consecutive steps .
14	slightly open the needle holder with the thread wrapped around it , grab the 3 - 5 centimeter ( 1.2 - 2.0 in ) of thread on the right side with the needle holder .
14	again , start with the instrumental tie at the beginning of the wound in order to fix the thread in place but do not cut the excess thread .
14	continue to puncture the right and left sides of the wound , respectively , bringing them together .
14	like before , start this altered version of the simple running suture with an instrumental tie at the beginning of the wound and then puncture the skin about a cm from the instrumental tie on the right and left side of the wound , respectively .
14	before pulling the thread completely to seal the wound , it 's very important to make sure that the loop is on the lower side of the suture pad ( towards you ) .
14	continue performing steps 1 and 2 multiple times along the extent of the wound and end the suture with an instrumental tie to prevent any loosening up to take place . note : you will notice that a line will form on the left side of the suture , which provides extra firming , allowing the suture to remain in place .
14	travel under the skin to the left side of the wound and bring out the needle at the same distance , so approximately 2 centimeter ( 0.79 in ) out from the wound site .
14	turn the needle around 180 degrees with the help of the tissue forceps and hold it with the needle holder . this will make the next step easier . do not use your hands to adjust and turn the needle around .
14	the next puncture site inwards will be on the same side of the wound ( left ) and halfway between the puncture site made in step 2 and the wound .
14	finally , take a bite outwards on the right side of the wound , halfway between the initial puncture site and the wound.the 4 puncture sites are represented by the 4 red dots .
14	start at the beginning of the wound and take a bite inwards approximately 1 centimeter ( 0.39 in ) from the wound site.leave approximately a 3 centimeter ( 1.2 in ) of the thread loose .
14	next , take an outward bite parallel to the previous one , but on the opposite side of the wound .
14	"moving alongside the same side of the wound ( left ) , take an inwards bite about 2 centimeter ( 0.8 in ) from the previous bite . a "" line "" will form between the second and third bites ."
14	the last bite for this suture is across from the third suture , taken outwards about 2 centimeter ( 0.8 in ) from the first bite . the puncture sites are represented by the 4 red dots .
14	to end this suture , perform an instrumental tie and cut excess thread . with the suture pad placed horizontally in front of you , it will seem that you are moving horizontally along the wound , hence this suture 's name .

100	understand your purpose behind understanding your website audience .
100	understand the different ways that the information might be inferred and how this affects the reliability of the data . note that all analytics services in widespread use work by sending data through javascript to third - party websites , and use cookies ( first - party for tracking a user within a site , and third - party for tracking users across sites ) to identify users .
100	understand the concepts of composition and index . for any dimension ( such as age , gender , ethnicity , income bucket ) we can consider the composition of your website visitors based on that dimension .
100	keep in mind that composition and index are both relative : neither measure how popular the site is on the whole with various subpopulations . the composition is a measure of the relative proportion from different subpopulations .
100	keep in mind the feedback loop between how you promote your website and what audience it attracts .
100	for benchmarking social media statistics , use tools like sociograph.io to get lists of top engagers with websites in your reference class . keep in mind that , due to limitations in the data facebook shares through its api , sociograph.io is unable to display demographic and geographic summaries of users .

100	retrieve your website 's age composition using your analytics tool ( such as ga ) .
100	the main thing to keep in mind with age is that composition and index can paint quite different pictures . one reason is that a lot of internet use is concentrated among people between the age of 18 and 34 .
100	compare your website 's age composition against benchmarks and against common sense .
100	retrieve your website 's location information using your analytics tool ( such as ga ) .
100	for city - level data , concentrate on only the top cities by composition . unless your website gets a really huge amount of traffic , the data for cities other than the top few would be too noisy and unreliable .
